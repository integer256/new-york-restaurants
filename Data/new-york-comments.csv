2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Da Andrea,"service was great & food was spectacular! definitely try out the fresh baked buns with prosciutto. the texture of the buns was so chewy, with cheese and prosciutto to complement it!","35 W 13th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Da Andrea,"If you are looking for a warm evening with no frills, this is the place to be. The food was absolutely fantastic. The ambiance was the perfect warm atmosphere. But the most impressionable aspect about our visit here was the hospitality. Sidy, the manager, was very attentive to our needs and tried his absolute best to get us the best table he could. Kadir, our waiter, was very polite and available to help us anytime.They somehow perfected the art of making a staple classic, Spaghetti Bolognese, and their Ravioli will leave me sleeping well at night. Not only that, they provided us with a free dessert to top it all off. A perfect night for our visit in the city before we run our New York Fashion Week show.","35 W 13th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Da Andrea,"Would definitely recommend Da Andrea! We sat outside on a hot and humid evening and were pleasantly surprised how comfortable it was, they had fans blowing. We all got different types of pasta and pizza and enjoyed trying everyone's plate! Top favorites were the spaghetti carbonara and gnocchi. Our service was okay, but overall had a wonderful time!","35 W 13th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-09-10,2023-09-16,Da Andrea,nice food! really liked the spinach ravioli  amazing service and nice outside seating:),"35 W 13th St New York, NY 10011"

2023-09-10,2023-09-16,Da Andrea,"This gorgeous restaurant is just by Parsons, and I have always found the floral decor to be so enchanting and inviting. Service was fast even though it was a busy Saturday night, and our waiters were very attentive and friendly. The amount of water in my cup was never less than half.For our appetizer we ordered the Insalata Tiepida Di polipo. The octopus was tangy and slightly salty, which brought a harmonious balance between the well seasoned potatoes and zesty olives. The chopped tomatoes were juicy and warm. The sauces were also sweet and flavorful. Finally, the bread was light and fluffy, and the olive oil was a wonderful companion.I ordered the Pappardelle which was served with sweet sausage ragout and truffle oil. The pappardelle was thick and delicious, and the sauce was decent. The meat was alright, and the cheese was yummy and complemented the dish wonderfully. Overall it was good, but I'd try something else if I came back.The capri was sweet and fruity, with a nice smell and a substantial amount of alcohol. Appearance-wise, there was a small pretty flower in the drink which added to the lovely color.","35 W 13th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Da Andrea,"I brought my son and his girlfriend for her birthday after seeing a film, Tribeca Film Festival. we went for brunch. I have to say the Aqua Marina salad, which is crab meat, hearts of palm, frisée, fennel, avocado with lemon dressing is to die for!  My new favorite salad.  Perfect!.  We also had the Polenta Fungi, Fettucine al Tartufo, and the Chitarra Alla carbonara, all delicious!  The bread is also yummy.  My only complaint is because this was a birthday, I notified the restaurant after making the reservation that when I ordered dessert, I requested a candle in the dessert.  Also advised when I arrived.  The dessert came without the candle, they tried to make up for it by bringing little cookies and a pot of some type of cream, not good,, just placed on the table.  No Birthday Fanfare.  Would have been a 5 star rating except for the Birthday disappoint.","35 W 13th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-09-05,2023-09-16,Da Andrea,"Coming into the restaurant we were kindly greeted by the host Sidy who guided us to our table. Our server Tatiana was very attentive throughout the entire experience and made sure that everything was amazing. The food was top quality and had some selections that I have not seen at other Italian restaurants which was exciting to see. Overall, the entire staff provided us a magnificent dining experience that will be remembered for the next time we come to New York.","35 W 13th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-09-05,2023-09-16,Da Andrea,"Amazing food, fresh seafood, and accommodating in regards to special requests. Definitely worth a trip during a night out","35 W 13th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Joe's Shanghai,"Good food good pricesI liked the crispy fried beef, and the chickenBut sometimes crowded","46 Bowery St New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Joe's Shanghai,"This place gets really packed. This place ONLY ACCEPTS CASH, but they do have an ATM where you can withdraw cash. I ordered the Pork Meat Soup Dumplings, which comes in 8 and Shanghai Sauteed Flat Noodle. The Pork Meat Soup was okay...the meat was a bit bland but tasted well with the vinegar and soy sauce mix they provided. The Shanghai Sauteed Flat Noodle was really good and seasoned well! The service here was great, everyone was on top of it and would come by and change your dirty plates to clean plates. If you need something, they're quick to give it to you.Recommendation(s):- Shanghai Sauteed Flat NoodleService: 5/5Tip(s):- Accepts only cash, but they do have an ATM","46 Bowery St New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Joe's Shanghai,Simply never disappoints. You really just need to get the dumplings and some scallion pancakes and you'll be all set,"46 Bowery St New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Joe's Shanghai,"Lived up to the hype.  My 2nd time in New York and my wife's first time. Long line, service was prompt and food was outstanding. I see why it has won so many awards.","46 Bowery St New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-10,2023-09-16,Joe's Shanghai,The crab dumplings were very good but the beef soup noodles were a bit on the spicy side. The scallion pancakes were a bit bland but the crunch factor was great. The young chow fried rice was on the salty side but the rice cakes was decent,"46 Bowery St New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-10,2023-09-16,Joe's Shanghai,"Great restaurant with vegetarian specific options. Veg dumplings and lo mein were fresh and amazing. Service is good, no complaints except that they accept only cash, so be prepared. Ambiance is crowded, wouldn't recommend for a date.","46 Bowery St New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-04,2023-09-16,Joe's Shanghai,"I went to Joe's on a Holiday Monday right at opening. I did not have to wait. Service was quick. My husband and I ordered the pork soup dumplings, sesame chicken, and beef pan fried noodles. The pork dumpling was good but not great. It needed some salt and the texture of the pork was different than I've tried. The actual dumpling was good and there was enough soup inside. The sesame chicken was crispy and sweet. The beef pan fried noodles were very good as well. The beef was not overcooked. The noodles were soft and crunchy.The inside was big. Some of the tables were close to each other.Would I come back? Maybe for different entrees but not the soup dumplings.CASH ONLY!","46 Bowery St New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-04,2023-09-16,Joe's Shanghai,"I had a light bite at Joe's Shanghai, because it was convenient for a business meeting. I liked it well enough to suggest it for dinner with another couple at the end of the month, and they selected this from among the three options I listed.They were bustling before the dinner hour, or what would be an early supper, just after 5pm. They had a mix of people.The server was fast. He was gracious.We had the rice noodles (rice cake) with seafood and a dumpling soup. The former was a bit smoky, which is good. The latter was fresh, tasty, healthy, and clean; it had watercress, which whenever I eat it, I think I need to have that vegetable more often.For a casual, not expensive, but friendly and family friendly restaurant, you should consider Joe's Shanghai.","46 Bowery St New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Joe's Shanghai,No reservations and cash only !!Their XLBs were way better than Din Tai Fung's not gonna lie And the crepes/wraps for the Peking duck were perfectly thin!,"46 Bowery St New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Joe's Shanghai,"Overall, we were pleased with everything we ordered. Our favorites were:- Xaio Long Bao (highly recommend)- Crab and Pork Soup Dumplings (highly recommend)Wait times can be long. We arrived at 2 pm on a Sunday, which was over an hour wait for our party of 8.","46 Bowery St New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-13,2023-09-16,Juliana's,So my sister said we had to go here because I love pizza !!! She was like you can eat and entire pizza alone ! She wasn't wrong !! Juliana's is very flavorful and light so you can truly enjoy your entire meal.  We got there at a good time because we walked right in and were seated. We didn't wait to long at all. It was a bout 1 PM by the time we received our food and there were a bunch of people waiting outside to come in.  Paired my food with root beer.,"19 Old Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Juliana's,I'm not too crazy about pizza and I also think pizza is just pizza but I tried Juliana's pizza for the first time and it was by far the BEST pizza I've ever had. The flavors were like no other. Let's not forget about the meatballs. Just perfection. The sauce was so freaking good.Food 10/10Service 10/10Location was very chill.,"19 Old Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Juliana's,"After a full day of exploring Brooklyn and New York, I was on the hunt for some pizza, and this place popped up. Arriving during lunchtime, I was seated promptly, although I should note that they don't offer pizza by the slice, which was my initial plan. Instead, I opted for a personal-sized Margherita pizza, which seemed to be a popular choice on the menu.I had the privilege of sitting at the bar, where I could watch the skilled pizza makers in action, handcrafting and tossing the dough with impressive flair. It provided some entertaining visuals while I waited for my meal.When my pizza arrived, I was in for a treat! The tomato sauce and cheese tasted wonderfully fresh, and the crust was a standout feature. It had just the right thickness and was perfectly crispy, which is exactly how I prefer it.The service was also excellent; my waiter was friendly, and I was regularly checked on to ensure I had everything I needed. All in all, this is a fantastic spot to savor authentic New York pizza when you find yourself in Brooklyn!","19 Old Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-10,2023-09-16,Juliana's,"I am a local and my friend from Alabama was here in NYC for the first time and wanted a margarita pizza. Juliana did  NOT disappoint. The  food is good and it's quality. The service is professional. The waiters wait on you at an even pace in such a busy place, which makes it pleasant.  Ambience is nice but small. Line is long but it moves pretty good.","19 Old Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-09,2023-09-16,Juliana's,Amazing pizza that's well worth the long lines. Loved both of the pizzas we got. With the open kitchen you can even see them making the pizzas. Staff was super friendly and always checking in on us. Definitely stopping by whenever I'm in the area.,"19 Old Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-08,2023-09-16,Juliana's,"Best pizza I've had in New York.As far as a classic New York pizza, it's the second best I've had, second only to a pizza place owned by a guy who was from NYC, but moved to the Midwest because it's so cheap, but he has since closed down, so yeah, Juliana's is the best New York style pizza, and arguably the best pizza I've had. There are times I crave different styles of pizza (Chicago, Detroit, classic grease pie, etc.), but as far as a classic style pizza, it's hard to be Juliana's.","19 Old Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-08,2023-09-16,Juliana's,"First time trying NYC style pizza and this is the best place to have it! Great service, helpful staff and family style ambience. Love the classics, vegetarians are not limited on options with the topping customizations.","19 Old Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Juliana's,"This place was wonderful.  We timed it such that we didn't have a wait for 3 people, so that was nice.  The person at the podium wasn't super friendly and seemed a bit annoyed, but that was the only person I noted that wasn't really friendly.  The food was great - we got a medium margherita and added sausage, plus a small white with mushrooms and peppers.  Everything was delicious and we managed to eat everything.  I would definitely come back!","19 Old Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Juliana's,"Great pizza - high quality. However, always a line out the door. Worth a stop by if I'm the area, but be prepared to wait an hour","19 Old Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-01,2023-09-16,Juliana's,"Awesome place. Husband, his family from Italy (3), and I arrived at 3:50ish to a line waiting for the 4:00 reopening of the restaurant. Fate wanted us to get seated during the first wave of crowd in the evening because it grew as the minutes went by and even after we finished our zas and left the perimeter.The place was very bustling even as we waited to get in. It got very crowded very quick, but it was handled well, efficiently, and the guy doing the head counts did a great job sitting us and everyone else.Interesting to know the history of Juliana's and the next door Grimaldi's! (Someone wrote it out down here and you can google as well). I went to Grimaldi's ten years ago with cousins so had to try this 4.5star-er obviously and ask what the Italian family thought of NY style pizza lmao. They loved it! There's definitely that char taste that's included that someone here wrote about that will or will not be your cup of tea. Personally, I don't care much for the wood oven taste, but it's appreciated when I do come across such a place. The tartness of the tomato sauce on the margherita was *chef's kiss*, and so was the not tomatoey at all-scallion pancetta no. 1. They're both equally tasty to me.I do gotta say it's easy to get thirsty when you're chomping down delicious pizza. I know it's Brooklyn, and the sodas are a little more special because they're the ones that are imported (or well at least I hope they are) and come in bottles, but I am still so dehydrated after spending that much on a drink. ($4-$5) Can y'all like. Get generic soda so this isn't a problem? Hehe. Just kidding. Be quenched with a nice icy tap if you're a little frugal like me.","19 Old Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Time Out Market New York,Came here for an afternoon lunch.  The place was clean and there were a.lot of.options.  I tried the Mediterranean food and that was good.  The falafel was well made and the hummus was yummy!  Just a.fun place to wander!  I've been to a few of the Time Out Markets in different cities and they always seem to have good food options!  I'd come back!,"55 Water St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Time Out Market New York,"An incredibly busy restaurant with mostly great, delicious food in one of the more well known neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Be prepared to wait, but it is worth it. Coffee, pancakes, and Biscuit Egg Sandwich are worthwhile purchases, tasty and filling.Only complaint is that portions do not match the prices.","55 Water St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Time Out Market New York,"This is now my favorite food hall in NYC! I absolutely love all the outdoor seating options and the quality of the vendors there.We started off with tofu pad Thai from Wayla, which was a 10/10. It was full of flavor and the noodles were fantastic.Then we had blueberry pancakes from Clinton Street Baking Co. I'm not exaggerating when I say these were the best pancakes I have had in my life.Views from both the rooftop and outdoor seating on the main level are epic. Such an amazing way to enjoy the waterfront.I can't wait to return and try more things.Wheelchair access: no problem with entry from outside. There are indoor and outdoor elevators you can take to reach the rooftop level. The rooftop has one step down to the seating area but there is a gate on the side of the seating that a manager can unlock for wheelchair access. It requires asking people to move tables. Very poorly thought through as they could have either made the main entrance ramped or moved the tables to make area by the gate more accessible and left the gate open. One shouldn't have to wait for management to show up to simply access a seating area while disabled. I did not use the bathrooms so not sure of their accessibility.","55 Water St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Time Out Market New York,"It's a very good place to stop and spend some time to eat , have some drinks, wonderful foods, drinks options,","55 Water St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-02,2023-09-16,Time Out Market New York,Amazing food market in Dumbo. Worth checking out. Beware it's typically swarming with tourists and the bathrooms are sus. The food is good but overpriced. Great waterfront city views from the back of the market with benches to sit on.,"55 Water St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-01,2023-09-16,Time Out Market New York,Good food options. Only thing is it's a little dark inside and very tight surroundings with little space in the walkways/aisles between the vendors and seating areas.,"55 Water St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-08-29,2023-09-16,Time Out Market New York,It's a fancy and pricey food court.Total bill was $28 for the meal pictured below with a small tip and no beverage. It was overly greasy and not very good. The location and decor is nice but I wish I had gone to and patronized a more authentic Brooklyn establishment.,"55 Water St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Time Out Market New York,"Dough Time Out Market in DUMBO's Time Out Market might just have served me the best donut I've ever had. The dough was unbelievably light and airy, and the flavors were simply extraordinary. While other vendors in the market looked enticing, we limited ourselves to the donuts - a choice that certainly paid off.","55 Water St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-08-26,2023-09-16,Time Out Market New York,"I finally got a chance to check out this Time Out marketplace. I went on a weekday which was great because there was plenty of parking around the area. The first floor of the building had plenty of different foods to choose from. I got a matcha drink from Cha Cha. My lunch was from Mr. Taka Ramen. I got the veggie gyoza and chashu rice bowl. It was so delicious! There was seating but probably because it was a weekday. The upper floor has some more food places and alot of scenic places to take pics and sit. I can see how it would get crowded on the weekend but it's a great place to have lunch or a drink and see the views of Manhattan. Brooklyn bridge, the carousel  and Manhattan bridge. It's beautiful! I plan to visit again.","55 Water St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-08-26,2023-09-16,Time Out Market New York,"The market has really expanded into a huge indoor, outdoor and rooftop food hall. Everything imaginable from liquor to ice cream, sushi, barbecue... Lots of clean seating, helpful staff, and endless views of Manhattan and the Hudson River.","55 Water St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-15,2023-09-16,ARIARI,"Was excited to go given all the hype around their Busan style Korean late night snacks. We got 6+ texts throughout the day to make it to the restaurant on time which was overly excessive.We didn't have to wait on a Thursday night and started off with good Korean cocktails which were pretty good but PQR was not the best (small whiskey glass with maybe 2 shots worth of drinks for $14-17). Got 5 drinks in total.We ordered makHwe - Korean sashimi ($30ish) which was a small plate of fluke and yellowtail. Definitely overpriced and nothing special. Yookhwe (beef tartare) with baby octopus ($15) was ok but nothing special. Oh Sam bulgogi (pork + fried squid - $25) was unique and the squid was perfectly fried but low PQR again.As everyone suggests, dolsot albap ($18)) was our favorite and was worth paying for.The total damage after tip and tax was $200 and had some unique fusion experience but won't be a place I would return.","119 1st Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-12,2023-09-16,ARIARI,"It's kinda okay. We ordered the uni dolsot al-bap and it was underwhelming. You can't really taste the uni, just cream and rice. The beef tartare was pretty good, and the soft shell crab was probably similar to tempura. Would come here again if a friend wanted to go but def would not be a recommend on my list. Ambiance was great though!","119 1st Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,ARIARI,"All the dishes were very flavorful and unique. Of the dishes I got, my favorite would be the mak-hoe. The fish was very fresh. The fried dishes were very unique as the fried dough was very airy and light. I love beef tartare but this beef tartare had more octopus to beef ratio. Something to note if you are a beef tartare lover and are expecting a lot of beef. But very solid place. We were surprisingly full from these dishes. Would really recommend. The drinks here are amazing!","119 1st Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,ARIARI,"Definitely a solid 4/5 stars for the food! It's pretty small inside, and they have an outdoor dining enclosed space too that's where the actual street/parking is. That setup kinda sucks for the waiters though because they have to walk through everyone in the streets to get to the outdoor dining space.But service was seriously impeccable - the staff are stationed, it seems, like every corner so they're always there if you need anything. We got our waters poured for us almost every time we drank, we had plates cleared immediately to make space for the next ones (but they left the sauces for us), and they even helped me wiped my table after a few dishes as they noticed I was taking a lot of pictures.In terms of food, it did live up to the hype for the most part, but I'd say that the one dish that got the most hype turned out to be the most underwhelming one. Yep, that's the dolsot al-bap, which is the fish roe/sea urchin cream that gets mixed into the rice, tableside. I'll get to that later. Let's start with the best:Fried Soft Shell Crab $18: it's two crabs cut into halves, so four pieces. I'm used to, and love, the salt and pepper soft shell crabs at Chinese restaurants and order it all the time. But Ariari really wowed me with how they did this! It's so simple, but the batter is insanely crispy and light, and it all holds together. Fresh crab, seasoned well, pairs deliciously with the aioli that they serve this with. I just loveee the coating of this. It does get greasy, so one or two pieces per person is more than enough. The waiter was just as shocked when I said that this was my favorite dish of the night haha.I initially wasn't even about to order this dish as I had my eyes set on the lamb stuffed peppers, but they didn't have that available that night so the crab was a replacement. DEF meant to be. Order this!Yook Hoe $15: this is the beef tartare with baby octopus. This dish has the most flavor and was soo creamy. A must order again for me if I come back with friends. The texture of the octopus was especially good, I felt like they gave even more octopus than beef. Doesn't matter, the combination of the meat, seafood, and fried onions was perfect.Scallop DIY Gimbap: While the scallop was fresh and everything went well together, I think this was definitely quite pricey for the portion. Beautiful presentation, tastes good, but the scallop was sliced so thinly that it was probably just one or two whole scallops at most put together. I made hand rolls out of this, but I also added the yook hoe to make the rolls bigger/packed. This one I would say is a bit hard to share, unless you don't mind each roll only have a tiny sliver of scallop. I don't think this is really worth it exactly, it wouldn't even cost as much at an omakase. Still delish, nonetheless.Squid and Pork: actually very generous with the pork here! Flavorful, sweet, a bit spicy. It's good, just not uniqueDolsot Al-Bap $19: here comes the dish that I've been seeing all the videos about! Unfortunately, I hyped myself too much? I was expecting something with more umami and the rice to be a lot creamier. But it was on the drier side for a rice dish. I didn't taste too much of the fish roe flavors, it was more of a seaweed mixed rice. It was still fine, just not as good as I thought it would be. It needed more salt at the very least.","119 1st Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-10,2023-09-16,ARIARI,"great food and drinks, lovely selection of food from Busan! awesome music and good looking waiters were a plus.","119 1st Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-10,2023-09-16,ARIARI,"Tried the scallop diy gimbap, soy braised lotus root salad, and dolsot al bap. FIRST, a special shout-out to the staff here - everyone was so kind and made it a great dining experience!Anazing food, fun flavors, and perfect sizes for sharing. The lotus root salad was my fav - lots of different flavors, and the dressing was sooo good. Scallop gimbap was a classic & scallop was sooo fresh and tender. Dolsot al-bap was also good, but i didn't think it was as impressive as other two. The taste of the uni didn't come through as much as I would have wanted. Overall would highly recommend making a reservation to try it out!","119 1st Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-08,2023-09-16,ARIARI,Came for a last minute dinner with a friend and we were able to get sat in their covered outdoor section easily. The food was all super well done and fresh! My fave was the beef tartare,"119 1st Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,ARIARI,"Hmm it's a 4 but not a strong 4Scallop DIY: nah it's thin as balls and you could barely taste the scallopPancake: it's good and crispy, i liked this oneDolsot al bap: yummy in tummy and i drooledHap-cheon pork soup: nah it's so uninteresting. Really normal soup, didn't make my pants pop off.Overall i'm disappointed but i'd still potentially come back.","119 1st Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,ARIARI,"This was Saturday dinner at 7:15pm for outdoor seating. I am so happy I found an availability at an appropriate time because this restaurant is amazing. The dishes were amazing!My friends and I ordered scallop DIY gimbap & octopus sook-hoe and Salmon hoe gooksu as cold appetizers. The winner was the salmon hoe gooksu from these three cold dishes. The other two were good too, but the flavors in this dish was the best. Wish they added more sobu tbh.For hot dishes, we ordered glazed jang-eo and Dolsot al-bap. These went well together as flavorful fried seafood eel complimented the hot stone bimbim bap. As a drink, we got dae sun soju which was affordable and perfect with our dinner.I want to come back here and try the stews in the winter. Also, snag an indoor spot so we don't have to travel in and out for the restroom.","119 1st Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-02,2023-09-16,ARIARI,I was a little wary of trying this place given that I found it on TikTok and I'm also korean so expectations are high. But overall it wasn't bad. Would only come back for the dolsot Al bap though5/5 - Dolsot Al BapHuge fan of fish eggs and loved that there was a ton in every bite. I would come back to order a large size if they had it on their menu3/5 - scallop DIY handrollTasted like something my fiancé and I bought at the korean market and made ourselves.3/5 - duck bulgogiNothing special. Hard pass2/5 - corn crème brûléeCrème brûlée is my favorite dessert so I was intrigued with the corn version. I wish they either put more corn or none at all. The top could've been harder too.Aside from the dolsot Al bap another one of our favorites was the free kimchi salad. That was actually reeeeeally tasty and we ended up killing 3 plates.Service 5/5. All the guys were really nice and attentive. Super hardworking too.,"119 1st Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-05,2023-09-16,Salma,Ordered on Uber eats.Did the BOGO deal for the filet sandwich. It was pretty good. Will get it again.Delivery- did not follow all directions on order but overall it came out ok. Would order the sandwich again.Great for a Quick meal.Also ordered the eggplant dip - it was not anything to write home about. So def skip that if you're eyeing it.,"351 E 12th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-21,2023-09-16,Salma,"The restaurant boasts a warm and inviting ambiance, along with exceptional service and delectable food. I was particularly impressed by the authentic and fresh hummus, as well as the mixed platter. This experience has led me to believe that I've discovered my favorite Lebanese restaurant in NYC. I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment.","351 E 12th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-07-26,2023-09-16,Salma,"Have gotten delivery and eaten in-house. Portions are absurdly large, especially in person, and the food is SO SO GOOD. The quality is excellent, as well. Vibes/decor inside is excellent - reminds me of Ducks, the prior business, which is a good thing, because it had a comfortable, classy-without-trying-too-hard feel - and the service was excellent, even on a busy Friday night. Got Sara's mint tea, even on a warm summer evening, which WAS SO SO GOOD! Highly recommend putting this on the permanent menu. Love this business for the neigborhood. We will be regulars.","351 E 12th St New York, NY 10003"

2023-06-13,2023-09-16,Salma,"The only thing redeeming about this place was the ambience, the spicy potatoes and the hummus. Decorated in a super cute way with lots of plants and cute lamps, it gives off a very homely rustic vibe. Overall the food could be better! We ordered the chicken and lamb dishes and while the portions were amazingly big, the food could've been seasoned better.The falafel wrap was average and the fries were good but also heavily seasoned.The potatoes were a redeeming quality. Would definitely get the potatoes starters and just enjoy a meal of sides rather than the main dishes.The service was kind of confusing(?). When we sat down the host was definitely trying to rush us to order and kept coming to our table 2-3 times asking us if we're ready. However, our food took a pretty long time after. Our starters arrived quickly but we had finished them and still had to wait a while before our mains came. Although I can imagine they were busy for a Tuesday night, which is understandable, but then don't rush folks to order?","351 E 12th St New York, NY 10003"

2023-05-10,2023-09-16,Salma,"All the stars go to friendliness of the people working there. They were sweet, very welcoming and quick to seat and serve us. With that, it definitely built up the expectation of amazing food to go with the service. Unfortunately they didn't match up.The QR scan menu was easy to scroll through with lots of pictures. We wanted to share some light plates since it was already pretty late in the evening. We ordered fattoush salad, moutabal eggplant and falafel sandwich. It all came out pretty quick with a side of pita bread.- salad was overdressed with strong vinegar dressing overwhelming the taste of the vegetables. It unsuccessfully tried to mask old soggy cucumber slices and hard cardboard-like tomato. We didn't finish it- eggplant had an interesting taste to it. At first I liked it but then it started to feel like fake smoke or meat grease mix that gave that aftertaste- falafel sandwich was dry with a stale deli pita around it. I avoided the pita basket after trying to the falafel (didn't take a pic. It was underwhelming)Sad! Wish it was better! Hope it will will improve!","351 E 12th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Soothr,"They're super busy/packed, but we were still able to do a walk in with about a 30 minute wait on a Friday night. The food does come out really fast and they have a time limit of 1 hour and 15 minutes per table, so that also helps with the turnaround. There's both indoor & outdoor seating; we didn't get to choose which, but didn't mind either way.For food, we got:Ba Mii Karee Pu (Chef Special Sautéed Jumbo Lump Crab & Egg Curry Over Yellow Noodles) - good flavor, but not enough crabShrimp Pad Thai - classic, but nothing to write home aboutSeared Duck Green Curry - my favorite of the night; the duck is so tender and the curry is the perfect amount of spice for me, though it was a bit too spicy for my friend to enjoy when we ran out of the rice it came withDuck Noodles - loved the contrast of flavor from the slices of pickled gingerFor cocktails, we got:Ruby (Thai Herb Infused Vodka, Dry Vermouth, Cranberry & Pomegranate Juice) - tastes of lemongrass and herbs if you like that!Aqua Marine (Vodka, Pineapple Juice, Blue Curaçao, Lemon Zest, Cointreau) - very sweetPearl (Maker's Mark, Egg White, Orange Zest) - my favorite, but pretty standardDara Citrine (Tequila, Mezcal, Tamarind Syrup, Thai Chili, Salt, Lime Juice) - basically a spicy, smokey margarita if you're into thatDefinitely a bit pricy but worth trying!","204 E 13th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Soothr,"Dropped into Soothr for a birthday dinner as a group of 6. We were running a bit late but they still held the table for us for around 20 minutes which was much appreciated.5/6 of us ordered the Kong Karee, which seems to be the star of their menu. Contrary to rave reviews here, while the Kong Karee was good, I don't think it was anything particularly mind-blowing. If I was in the area and managed to grab a res I'd definitely visit again but probably wouldn't go out of my way to wait more than 30 minutes for a table.","204 E 13th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Soothr,"I was recommended to check out this place on my trip to New York and I'm really glad I did!We ordered the duck noodles, pad Thai, khao soi, and the beef and roasted vegetable masamun curry - everything to share. Everything was done perfectly and everyone in our group had a different favourite dish. The khao soi was too spicy for me but the spice lover in our group enjoyed it.The service was also really good and attentive. We had our glasses of water refilled many times without even asking.If you can book a reservation early! We booked ours a few weeks before and there were only a few time-slots available.","204 E 13th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-13,2023-09-16,Soothr,"Before arriving to my dinner reservation at Soothr, I had to first email them as I was arriving in a party of 6. We were greeted warmly by staff upon our arrival and shown to our table, which was already prepared for us. The interior of the restaurant is quite pretty and the red lights made me feel like I was in the set of a Wong Kar Wai movie (I later found out there was actually a photograph from one of his movies above our table).We had heard great things about their tom yum seafood hot pot ($26) and their koong karee ($24), and also ordered some Thai iced tea ($7 each), duck rolls ($14), and shrimp pad thai ($18). Our server was very nice and patient and gave us a few recommendations we went along with, including the duck noodles ($24) and stir-fried morning glory ($12). He also noticed that I was taking pictures of the food (which came out very red due to the lighting) so he brought out a lamp to help-- have I mentioned the service is fantastic?Our food came out with almost no wait at all. The staff moves quickly and efficiently, and made sure to check on us a few times during our dinner. I thought the food overall leaned a little sweet and mild-- I am more used to the bold spicy and sour palate of Zaab Zaab and Ugly Baby. This is not to say my meal at Soothr was not satisfying, but I think if you prefer a spice level akin to Thai Diner, then Soothr will be right up your alley. I particularly enjoyed the tom yum seafood hot pot (though I felt it could be spicier and more tart, but felt it was absolutely laden with seafood), the koong karee (comforting, sweet, creamy shrimp-egg curry sauce), and the mango sticky rice ($15).","204 E 13th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Soothr,"Overall rating: 4.4Very unique spot that has rave reviews since it opened. Getting a reservation felt pretty easy, but walking into the restaurant was a bit difficult. They don't seat you until your party has arrived, which is normal... except there wasn't much space to wait around. If you're going with a group, I recommend hanging somewhere else nearby.This spot is only for a group setting. It's way too loud for solo in my opinion. When you're inside, you do feel a bit transported into another spot. I'm not sure how much, is too much decoration though. For me, it walked a very thin line between being authentic vs touristy.I went with a few friends who didn't eat pork & unfortunately 90% of the menu was pork.What I found odd, was a $$$ restaurant wasn't accommodating at all. There were no modifications or allowances that could be made. Not even to make a dish vegetarian. I'm not sure if it was because we didn't drink, but the waitress wasn't warm. It felt very rushed and they wanted us in and out.When we finally did order the food came out within 5-7 minutes. It was almost too quick. I've gathered it's because the dishes are just made in bulk waiting to be served, which is why you can't make any changes to the dish.That feels okay at a smaller place, but here it just rubbed me the wrong way.The food was good minus the Tom Yum soup, but the overall experience just felt off to me. I don't like feeling rushed when I'm spending a lot of money on a meal. Maybe that's just me.I do want to try it again on a different day, different time just to see if I feel the same.","204 E 13th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Soothr,"I was so excited to try Soothr because it came highly recommended by people that I trust, but I was really disappointed by the food that I ordered. The duck rolls were 14$ but was 99% stuffed with wood ear mushrooms and had maybe half a piece of duck split between 4 rolls. Wouldn't recommend it, unless you like feeling ripped off. I also ordered the crab curry noodle dish that's a mix of 2 signature dishes. The curry was too heavy for my taste, really lacking in crab, and way too sweet.  I wouldn't recommend this dish either.Service is fine and ambiance is fine. Nothing special in nyc. Maybe I didn't order right, but I don't think I'll go back unless someone really pushes for this place because there's a bunch of other Thai places that I prefer in nyc.","204 E 13th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Soothr,"I've tried Soothr delivery and dine-in. Both were good. I do prefer the delivery better since the restaurant gets really packed and LOUD! I went on a date here and it was hard to have a convo.Some things I've ordered: the crab fried rice, hoi johr dumplings, seafood tom yum, koong karee shrimp, vegetable masamun curry - all of which were delicious.The portions are on the smaller side and it's not cheap.

Go for the happy hour drinks and oysters and the seafood is fresh and tasty. Christina, the manager, checked in on us and made sure everything was going well and then asked to stay for their 7th anniversary party. Cecil totally rocked with the drinks.

2023-09-09,2023-09-16,Fish Cheeks,"Had a weekday dinner reservation for two people. There was a steady stream of people even during the weekday, so I definitely recommend making a reso. I know this place has a lot of hype - overall I thought it was good and worth checking out. I would come back just for the steamed fish. Also, for those who can't do spicy (like me) there are plenty of options that are clearly marked.Ambiance / Service: honestly, nothing too notable, but it's laid back and cozy. Service was great as well. My only qualm is that there were flies buzzing around inside that we had to constantly shoo away from the food.Food: I had heard that this place was known for spicy food, so I was a bit worried since I have a horrible spice tolerance. However, food is very clearly marked and there are a lot of options. Family style is the way to go. For two people we ordered the below (it was too much food - should've ordered one less entree):-Somtum Corn Salad: fresh and light. But nothing notable. I probably wouldn't order again.-Crab Fried Rice: delicious. Would 100% order again. It looks super basic in the photo, but it was sooo good. Sometimes fried rice can be pretty bland, but this had such good flavor.-Steamed Fish: THIS IS A MUST! I was hesitant at first because I don't love branzino, but you can't go here and not get this dish. It's well worth the $40. Soooo flavorful and so tender. Has a citrusy, tamarind, garlic broth that is delicious. I've never had something like this before.-Isan Style Grilled Chicken: chicken was cooked perfectly - charred on the outside, but juicy. However, it was a little bland, especially compared to the fish and rice. The sauces are key. Based on the other entrees we got, I wouldn't order again.","55 Bond St New York, NY 10012"
2023-09-08,2023-09-16,Fish Cheeks,"I've visited Fish Cheeks twice at this point. My first visit was ruined by the extremely rude hostess thus I didn't write a review, fearing it might have been bias from that interaction.A co-worker suggested we stop by for dinner a couple days ago and I reluctantly agreed. Once again, the hostess gave us really bad attitude when we said we didn't have a reservation. Outlandishly told us the wait for an inside table would be an hour and a half...which luckily ended up only being a 15 minute wait.Any ways, let's talk about the food. Just like last time, EVERYTHING is doused in fish sauce. I get the restaurant has the name ""FISH"" in it but must my grilled chicken  really taste like chicken of the sea? That distinct taste of fish sauce is enjoyable at small doses... when everything is doused in it, it just feels like they're trying to hide the freshness of the ingredients.Some of these prices are also pretty outrageous. $40 for a steamed branzino with some lemon grass...who's bothered about that!I really wanted to like Fish Cheeks...but this place is just NOT THAT GIRL. If you want Thai food, I recommend going to Thai Villa in union square. At least the hostesses, servers and staff members are polite and happy to serve you. Price point is much more fair in my opinion as well.","55 Bond St New York, NY 10012"
2023-09-08,2023-09-16,Fish Cheeks,"Fantastic Thai restaurant in the Village. They specialize in seafood (not a surprise given the name). Everyone should get the coconut crab curry - it's spicy, the seasoning in the curry is spot on and the crab meat is incredibly tender and juicy. We also ordered the somtum corn salad which is basically summer in a bowl, and it's got this amalgamation of all sorts of different flavors and textures (spicy, sour, sweet, crunchy, juicy) that works super well. The cocktails here are delicious too - every drink utilizes southeast Asian flavors to great effect and pairs great with the food. Prices here are on the high side but that seems to be the case with all restaurants these days.","55 Bond St New York, NY 10012"

2023-09-08,2023-09-16,Fish Cheeks,"~ Lobster Plaa (5/5) ~It's a refreshing and complex flavoured dish, love it to bits! The portion is surprisingly good, there are a lot of lobster meat, felt like it's more then half of the lobster! The meat is fresh, tender and bouncy. The coconut galangal sauce is very light and citrusy, doesn't overpower the lobster at all. It taste fantastic with Thai basil, garlic, shallot, mint, lemongrass!~ Prawn Karee (3.5/5) ~This curry is a bit too watery, but flavour is great though. Curry powder and soft scrambled egg are a match in heaven. The Prawn tasted fresh and bouncy, but perhaps a tad bit overcooked? The shell is a bit difficult to remove. Slightly disappointed in this, it could have been really good.Will I be back? YesI love a seafood based Thai resto, would love to come back and try other dishes!","55 Bond St New York, NY 10012"

The interior of the restaurant is charming and adds to the overall experience.I don't usually eat udon, but after trying it here, I can say with confidence that it is the best I have ever had. This place is a gem. It is always full of visitors, which creates a comfortable and lively atmosphere in which to enjoy fantastic food. Some of my favorite dishes include chicken karage, monkfish liver, fried oysters, and crab udon, which is my favorite dish.In my opinion, this restaurant is one of the best in New York.

Highly recommend you make a res if you can cuz there's usually a line during the mealtime or come wait in the line when the restaurant is about to open. Service is overall good and nothing to complain from my visits.For appetizers, I've had sabazushi, chawanmushi, and chicken tatsuta-age. They all tasted authentic. Cucumbers were okay simply because it's not too special compared to others.I've tried three types of hot udons so far: curry, gyunan, and kani ankake. The first two are probably one of their most popular items and so far my fav. I had kani ankake this time but not a fan because personally it's weird to have thicker broth like that in the udon.Overall, I will come visit again for sure!Follow me on IG for food/fun in NYC @whats_up_ny","48 Macdougal St New York, NY 10012"

For me it's the fulfilling udon noodles,  flavorful broths, and refreshing textures.We came here on a Saturday late afternoon around 2 pm and were able to join the waitlist to get seated in exactly 30 minutes. The staff were attentive and were able to order fairly quickly .I got the zaru soba with shrimp tempura on the side. The dipping sauce for tempura and soba brother was served in separate cups on the side. A simple yet elegant combination .  The tempura shiso served with the noodle was a nice touch. The dipping sauces for tempura was well seasoned and the broth for the noodles was nice and airy.I'm not usually one to get dessert where I dine but I decided to try their Soba pudding. It included a delicious sweet (buckwheat?) crisp as a topping .","48 Macdougal St New York, NY 10012"

2023-09-09,2023-09-16,Raku,"This place is worth the lines and wait! If you're able to, try to make a reservation on their website ahead of time. They will still take walk-ins however and you can leave your name and number. I waited for about 45 minutes since I didn't have a reservation and if you don't mind waiting, then you can walk around the area until they message you that your table is ready!I ordered the Gyunan Udon, Wagyu Tataki, and the Ebiten Udon.One appetizer to share and one udon for myself was plentiful and satisfying. I can definitely see why this place is hyped up and why they're know for udon.The broths were light and somehow still tasted rich. Udon noodles are thick and chewy which makes it very enjoyable and this place hit it spot on. Not a single drop of broth or food was left on all the plates.Highly recommend you check this place out! It's good for both hot and cold weather in my opinion.","48 Macdougal St New York, NY 10012"

There is a generous portion of tempura so you don't need to be stingy while eating and the udon itself is very flavorful.The tatsuta-age is also shockingly juicy and crispy at the same time. Must try.,"48 Macdougal St New York, NY 10012"
2023-09-08,2023-09-16,Raku,"As far as I know, this is the best udon in NYC. I came in at around 3PM to avoid the heavy lines during lunch and dinner rush hours and was able to actually be seated immediately. The service was great, and the inside of the restaurant felt very simplistic and elegant. I ordered the Niku Udon and added chili oil to add a bit of spice (would definitely recommend adding the chili oil!!!). The meat inside was very tender and flavorful, and the udon broth itself was delicious while still remaining clean and light. The noodles here are on a serious next level though. While I have heard they're shipped frozen from Japan, they are very light and springy and I couldn't get enough of them! Would definitely recommend Raku.","48 Macdougal St New York, NY 10012"

They are pretty strict on time so make sure to not be late for your reservation. The ambience was great, the decor and details made you feel like you were transported. The service was great. The people were kind. The food was super yummy. My friend did all the ordering. The spicy cucumbers were very refreshing and seasoned well. The broth in our noodles was clean and deep in flavor. The noodles were the perfect firmness that matched the broth and meat perfectly. I will say, it was expensive but worth it once in a while.

2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Raku,"I am a huge fan of udon, so naturally I had to check out this popular Japanese noodle joint in Soho. The wait time was pretty long for two people (~1 hour) but that was expected given that it was peak lunch time on Labor Day weekend, but it was well worth the wait. We ordered the chicken tatsuta-age which was incredibly crispy and juicy on the inside and contained a lot of meat. I ordered the yamakake cold udon dish which had a super refreshing broth topped with egg and bonito flakes, making it a perfect light noodle dish. The udon noodles were a much higher quality than other traditional udon dishes I've had before. All the dishes were also very reasonably priced. The interior was also gorgeous and had a clean modern Japanese style. The staff was super friendly and attentive, and the dishes came out quickly despite it being peak lunch time.

2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Celestine,We had an excellent meal here for my moms birthday. All of the food was wonderful and the staff was particularly attentive. The only thing I will mention is that the train is very loud if you are sitting outside. Not everyone will mind but it is important to note especially if there is someone hard of hearing in your party!,"1 John St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-08-31,2023-09-16,Celestine,"First is first. The best view I have gotten of New York City since moving here. I could just sit there and continue ordering food and drinks for the view. Mesmerizing.Food:Bare in mind, unless you have a monstrous appetite, it's best to share an entree and appetizer with your date.Fennel Roasted Half Chicken:Exquisitely seasoned, tender chicken. Loved every bite of it. The fingerling potatoes paired with the chimichurri sauce...I was sad when they were gone...Handcut French Fries:As a fan of potatoes in any preparation, these hit home with me. True to their name, freshly cut, perfectly-saltedand paired with gremolata and toum--a must--I reiterate--a must order!The service, considering how busy the restaurant gets during peak dinner hours, is on-point. Attentive and knowledgeable waitstaff.I'll be back for another scenic dinner date.","1 John St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-08-21,2023-09-16,Celestine,"The restaurant is a must-try primarily for its breathtaking views. The chicken sandwich and the doughnuts were both delectable. The sight of the East River and the Manhattan Bridge was truly stunning. I'm eager to return during the evening to witness the beauty of the scenery at night. Alongside the remarkable views, the restaurant offered great food and service, resulting in a wonderful overall experience.","1 John St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-08-06,2023-09-16,Celestine,"This restaurant is gorgeous... very cute and quaint. The inside is very sleek and outside had a lot plants to accompany being next to the water. However, I feel like that's all I can really say about it. To preface, we ordered pretty light so maybe if we tried more dishes I could offer a more whole review. However, we ordered their mezze platter and their lobster tagliatelle. Their mezze platter includes 4 of their dips. There was the marinated olives, pistachio feta, moussaa, pistachio feta, and housemade labneh. I was most excited to try the pistachio feta, which was just okay. There was a rare occurrence where I could say there is too much pistachio and it didn't complement in the way it should've. It was very thick, heavy, and nutty and was in desperate need of salt. The marinated olives felt like a waste... the olives looked like they were barely put in anything and tasted that same way! The housemade labneh was just alright and I think the grapes are a must with it, as it has no flavor without it. Lastly, the moussaa was GREAT! Best out of the four, but it was such a small serving and we were so upset. If I were to come back i'd just get the moussaa because the other dips aren't worth the price of the mezze platter. Moving on to the lobster tagliatelle it was very heavy! It is a lobster pasta dish with a beurre blanc sauce. First things first... the pasta came out cold, which to me was already a first no. They but an alright amount of lobster with it, so no points off there, but the pasta was just so plain. It was in desperate need of something to revive any sort of flavor. I left thinking it had potential to be a good dish if they added even a smidge of pepper. Overall.... it was pretty pricey even for these two small items and for the below average food, I don't know if I could say this is worth it. However, again great location and pretty restaurant!","1 John St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-07-05,2023-09-16,Celestine,"You come here for the views, not the service or food - at least not the brunch food.We brought visiting relatives here for brunch the Saturday before 4th of July and sat outside. The ambiance was wonderful. The patio overlooks (underlooks?) the Manhattan bridge and is surrounded by greenery and it's just heavenly. There is also a very nice breeze which was just perfect for the hot day we were there.The food is very mediocre but we expected that. The mezze platter was delicious but everything else was meh. I imagine the dinner food might be better as they seem to do a better job with the traditional Mediterranean cuisine. Service was also not great and our server had zero social skills. Gen Z, amiright?","1 John St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

2023-07-01,2023-09-16,Celestine,Was looking forward to try this place because of the views and I love Mediterranean food but was disappointed. The food wasn't bad but the portions were smaller than I expected and they took too long in between to bring out each item we ordered. Service was slow. Barely took pictures because I was starving in between waiting. The lamb skewers were the best thing I tried. The eggplant mezze was more tomato than eggplant. Chicken was okay & my friends drink was watered down. The restaurant itself is beautiful but don't think I'll be back,"1 John St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-05-28,2023-09-16,Celestine,"Came to this place with my husband wanted to have small bites and drinks, asked if they have outdoor seating available, the girl at the door told me there was no outdoor seating without even thinking or checking when we saw there was couple seats available out there, didn't give us any other response after that no... Not sure why or what made her giving us this kind of attitude, but the experience was definitely not pleasant and will not consider this place again...","1 John St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Cafe Mogador,"This charming neighborhood restaurant offers a delightful brunch menu and an intriguing drink selection. The pita bread is soft and delicious, though the fries are slightly crispier than my preference. Nonetheless, it's a worthwhile dining destination that I'd revisit for a meal or cocktails.Service is excellent, striking the right balance between friendly and prompt without being pushy. We started with hummus and babaganoush and everything was amazing. Warm bread would have enhanced the experience though. The rest of the meal was excellent and delicious as well.This cute brunch spot combines a Middle Eastern twist with tasty cocktails. The brunch options are excellent, featuring herby, Middle Eastern bread and appealing egg dishes. The leafy-roofed patio is a perfect summer touch.","133 Wythe Ave Brooklyn, NY 11211"

2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Cafe Mogador,"Stopped by here on the search for good Mediterranean food in Williamsburg and I am glad I did! Cafe Mogador has a great atmosphere and would be an ideal spot for a date night. I ordered the Lamb Kefta and was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was! It was a bit pricey so I would come back for special occasions, but I was definitely happy with my visit.","133 Wythe Ave Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-08-25,2023-09-16,Cafe Mogador,"If you've ever met someone who's been to Cafe Mogador, they will rave about it (it also was featured on a late night Williamsburg munchies video a while back). It was a long time coming, but I finally can say I went. My favorite thing I had here was definitely my drink. Forgot to take a photo, but opted for the Heartbeet cocktail because apparently I'm a sucker for a cocktail these days. It was a beautiful deep purple color and delicious! Reminiscent of a sangria but with more of a punch due to the tequila. I would come back here just for that drink.For food me and one other person split the halloumi, labne, tandoori chicken (was a special) and the chicken tagine in the apricot plum sauce. I thought the small plates were fine, but nothing extraordinary. The tagine was great, though. We got it with the couscous which had a great texture and I loved the whole dried plums and apricots that were in the sauce. In comparison to the hype of the restaurant, I'd probably give it a 3/5 but it was a solid meal (and not too expensive)!","133 Wythe Ave Brooklyn, NY 11211"

Our entrees included Vegetable CousCous, a chicken Tagine, and Lamb Shank. The lamb fell off the bone, the couscous with raisins and caramelized onions was delicious, and the chicken was so flavorful!After dinner, we shared a walnut baklava and a perfectly baked molten chocolate cake. Of course, we topped the whole meal off with mint tea!The service and ambience were great. Can't wait to go again!","133 Wythe Ave Brooklyn, NY 11211"

2023-08-12,2023-09-16,Cafe Mogador,"The food here was so good! I came with a group and we ordered an assortment of dips to start including the hummus, the eggplant dip, a spicy tomato dip, and the yogurt and cucumber dip. And don't worry if you don't finish your dips with the bread, they provide they will certainly bring out more! The dips are so good I could've just kept eating those for my whole meal. Then the group split a wide variety of dishes on the menu the lamb is super flavorful. And the check into Jeane had a lovely green herbaceous sauce. We also ordered the salmon special which was very simple but very good. The salmon was cooked perfectly and paired with a unique side salad. Overall, I absolutely love this place and I thought it was pretty reasonably priced. The wait staff took a while to bring out the cocktails, but they were worth wait.","133 Wythe Ave Brooklyn, NY 11211"

2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Mabu Hong Kong Cafe,Ordered:Curry fishballBaked tomato pork chop pastaSatay beef instant noodleHong kong style milk teaCame in around 12pm for lunch and all the food were warm. The staff recommended the baked pasta but it was very sweet and the cheese was already kind of hard when it came to the table. Curry fishball is $8 for 8 pcs which is pricey to begin with and tasted subpar. The flavor tasted like a diluted version of the japanese curry you buy off the supermarket. Satay beef was probably the best item we ordered but the soup was not hot and instant noodle tasted precook.Place feels very gimmicky and all the effort went to decor but not the quality of food.,"18 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"

We tried coming here on a couple of occasions when they first opened but the wait times were always long. The whole restaurant is so aesthetic with an extensive menu.I wanted to try everything on the menu but we ended up ordering the Pork chop and luncheon meat in a pineapple bun, Cheesy garlic curry bread bowl, Assorted meat over instant ramen, and of course, rice rolls. Honestly, the food was great and met our expectations. The pineapple bun sandwich and the bread bowl were my favorites- they packed a punch! The instant ramen wasn't too flavorful, but portion size was good!I look forward to coming back and trying out the rest of their menu.","18 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"

2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Mabu Hong Kong Cafe,"The line is extremely long on Saturday lunch - I waited 2 hours on line to get inside for just table of 2!! Super busy and tight spacing inside and my table was so small - it could barely fit all my food; however, very unique interior.Service is good, but hard to get their attention if I had anything else to ask for because it was so busy.My friend and I got so much food because we were like might as well try everything we want after waiting so long!-Lemon Ice Tea (4/5): so cute with the bear ice!! Not sweetened but good - there was syrup on the side to add to your liking for sweetness. The cup was a bit small and the ice is big, so it wasn't that practical to drink because the bear would sometimes touch my face as I drank the tea.-Hong Kong Milk Tea (5/5): Good, standard tea. This tastes a little bit more bitter than regular milk tea, but I personally like this.-Cheesy Bread with Curry Rice and Pork cutlet (3.5/5): Super delicious and flavorful. However, too much carbs - the bread is extra, and doesn't add to the dish. Cool concept though.-Cheesy Fries with Minced Pork under (4.5/5): This surprisingly wowed me. Very flavorful and the minced pork under the fries really added dimensions to this dish.-Rice with spam, sausage, pork chop, egg, and broccoli (3/5): Nothing special, I wouldn't order it here again personally.-Soymilk Toast (4/5): Really delicious and soymilk complements well with the toast.Overall, this place is overhyped in terms of food. For the vibes, it's nice but to wait 2.5 hours, it's not worth it. I would go to Kong Sikh Tong instead for really delicious authentic HK food with way shorter wait.","18 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-01,2023-09-16,Mabu Hong Kong Cafe,"It's a NO from me.I was super excited to try this place out; everything looked so good, and the décor was so cute. Trekked to Chinatown on a rainy day so there was no wait - walked right in. The perks ended here.The basement was pretty empty, the waitress sat us that the middle communal table sandwiched between two other parties. I asked to move to another table because there was not many people around and knowing us, we usually order a bunch of snacks to sample. She told me to wait and then came back 5mins later to tell me that if there are more customers later, I would have to give up my table; I agreed, we moved. After we sat down at the new spot, we ordered drinks, over rice, noodles, toast. Before the food even came out, the waitress comes back to inform us that it was LAST CALL. This chick is funny! Gives me issues about table seating's, tells me that I have to give up my seat if more customers come, yet within 10mins tells me its last call - the place is close LOL it was barely 530pm.Food - The chicken wings were good. Hot and juicy. Also ordered the fried squid (tentacles). Dont order this, its a oily pile of mush. All the batter is sliding off the squid and every bit you take is like taking a sip of oil.The satay beef instant noodle was basic. Nothing special. I did like the instant noodle flavor but I can also easily make that at home.The beef egg over rice dish was mehhh. While the beef was edible the rice was not really edible - it wasn't even cooked fully.The Instagram worthy bear milk tea only LOOKS good - taste like water. Nothing special. They also don't tell you that you have to add sugar to it LOL I got a big mouthful of blandness.Looks are deceiving. While this spot LOOKS so good and worth trying out, sadly it is only a feast for your eyes.","18 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"

As for the food, nothing disappointed (except the hk milk tea)- we tried to ovaltine French toast which wasn't what we expected, baked rice dish, the Tom yum noodles (which were prob my favorite!) and nothing was bad! Everything was pleasant overall. Would come back to try some more things on their menu since it's huuuge!","18 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"
2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Mabu Hong Kong Cafe,"Mabu Cafe captures the authentic vibe of a Hong Kong-style cafe right here in our city. The wait, about an hour on a busy Saturday, is made more bearable with their innovative iPad sign-in and app tracking system. What truly shines here is their food. The uniquely flavored instant noodles stood out, offering a delightful culinary experience reminiscent of Hong Kong's best. While the service is commendably quick once you're seated, be prepared for tight seating and limited bathroom facilities. Overall, Mabu Cafe is a must-visit for an authentic taste of Hong Kong, just come with some patience and pre-planning.","18 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"
2023-08-23,2023-09-16,Mabu Hong Kong Cafe,I've seen the review and I normally don't go to place with less than 4 stars . But wanted to try it myself and see if it's any good since it's so close by. Came here for lunch today with my friend. We got a few things to try. The wings we liked the size of it. It's okay. The food wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either. The milk tea was the worse type of Hong Kong milk tea I've had. First time here and last time here. Definitely a gimmick place. My entree with the instant ramen so easy to make but flavor is not there. Same with the baked rice. 15 minutes after we finished and left here. Both me and my friend got diarrhea. Not sure if it's not clean or something. But never coming back here again. I wasn't gonna give it a one star. Maybe a 2 star for the quality of the food. But after this stomach ache. For the price of our bill $50-60 which is everything you see in the pictures. Definitely would not recommend here for the food. Maybe if you are here for the pictures go ahead it cute and all. But you can't eat pictures.,"18 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"
2023-08-19,2023-09-16,Mabu Hong Kong Cafe,"I knew the food was not going to be that good, but we wanted to try a new place & see the decor. The decor was very fun & cute (giving tributes to hong kong). The food was not good as many have stated & it tasted nothing like how the cha chaan tangs in HK tasted like. I am just glad to have tried this place once.We waited over an hour to get seated on a Saturday at 1:40pm & most of the things were sold out: satay, egg yolk french toast, bolognese fries, etc. We settled for these items: 1) fried squid, 2) baked tomato cheese pork chop on spaghetti, 3) biscoff french toast.Fried squid - it was tender squid & not crispy or fried. The taste was ok. Overall, it was so so & nothing special.Baked tomato cheese pork chop on spaghetti - The pork chop & cheese was the best part but that spaghetti was not good quality & lacked taste. This item was also so so.Biscoff french toast - it was soggy bread with hard crust soaked in milk + biscoff. This item was not good.Male waiter was very nice & friendly. Food came out quick. If you pay cash, you get 5% off the bill. They prefer cash over credit card. The bathroom is inside the fridge door on the side.I will just stick to eating at Kong Sihk Tong for my hong kong cravings.","18 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"

Main course we had the Truffle Shuffle pizza and the shrimp scampi.

Service was friendly.We ordered the house bread (very good, though getting butter for it took a hot minute), then the tuna tartare, radiatore w meatballs and shrimp scampi linguine. The tuna was high quality but any of that fresh taste was completely overpowered by the far too acidic vinaigrette and overdone chopped up Kalamata olives mixed in. Disappointing, though thankfully it came with a little dish of fresh pizza bread that was actually delicious.Pastas were variable. The linguini was cooked well and generally fine if not super memorable. Radiatore pasta was over cooked and on the tough side, though the tiny meatballs were quite yummy -- only wish there were more of them!The pizzas here looked really good from afar and seem very popular, so we'd give TFD another chance for pizza purposes.","96 South St New York, NY 10038"

The decor was during for the modern Italian theme.The waitresses immediately came over, introduced herself and took our drink orders.While my friend recommend pizza & pasta, I decided to go with baked eggs from the brunch menu because I was craving eggs. My friend's ordered the Rita pizza & bucatini with shrimp. Should have gone with their recommendation.The eggs were colorful and tasty but it was not filling. Wished it came with some sort of bread or facaccia to complete the meal. My friend commented that get shrimp were overcooked though the pasta was delicious. I have to say the pizza probably was the best looking but can't comment on taste since I didn't have it.I was a little disappointed because the food I had want the best I've had comparatively to other places I've been. Final conclusion, I love the ambiance & service and would need to come back to this place and try a pasta or pizza dish which is more for what they are known for.","96 South St New York, NY 10038"

2023-09-11,2023-09-16,La Grande Boucherie,"I've come here numerous times with both family and friends, and have always had a good experience. This was the first time I sat at the bar with a friend, however, and the service was really bad. Our bartender took our initial order for drinks and an appetizer. The cocktails were very good, but then our server disappeared and we had to ask another bartender for our appetizer which had been forgotten about. Our original bartender was still working but never returned to ask if we wanted to order dinner or more drinks. We ordered with the other bartender who seemed extremely annoyed that she had to wait on us. We were polite customers so it was especially uncomfortable. When our dinner was brought out, the appetizer plates were never cleared. It honestly felt like we were a burden on the waitstaff, who never once asked if we needed anything or how things were. Pretty odd for a place that otherwise pays a lot of attention to detail. The food was good but unfortunately the bad service really overshadowed the experience. They definitely didn't ask if we wanted dessert, but by then we didn't want to stay any longer. Such a shame since I've always liked this place.","145 W 53rd St New York, NY 10019"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,La Grande Boucherie,"I'm not sure if we were here on an off day, or if they were short staffed, but almost every part of the experience was problematic.1. It was super warm inside the restaurant and we were crammed near the walkway2. My brother ordered the Wagyu burger and immediately found a hair in it without even touching it - they replaced it. The replacement burger was good, but this was so off putting for the rest of the experience.3. We ordered a basket of fries that came cold, and we sent it back. A new basket of fries also came out cold, and we decided not to pursue it any further. Mind you, it was more like a cup of fries for $14.4. We ordered the $72 prime rib and the server explained that the prime rib comes out medium rare to medium at most, I said that's great and prefer medium rare. What we got was nearly well done. We should've honestly sent it back.5. The French onion soup and escargot were meh at best. I've been to plenty of French restaurants and I know it's not fair to compare food here to Paris and the French Riviera, but even compared to other American Brasseries in NY, this place was not it.6. We spent $50 on two pieces of cheese smaller than the palm of my hand.This was supposed to be a lovely brunch for my mom's birthday, and unfortunately, the five of us were unhappy with the food and lack of service.","145 W 53rd St New York, NY 10019"

It's definitely on the pricier end, but it's one of the few places where the price point justifies the taste and quality of the food. Everything we've ever had here was delicious. The branzino was unbelievable. We've been a handful of times over the past 2 years, but this restaurant is more of a special occasion dinner spot and too expensive for a weeknight dinner.","89 South St Pier 17 New York, NY 10038"

2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Momofuku Ssam Bar,"A fun dining experience, the Ssam Bar features the grill in the center of the table where the waiter grills up the main meats and fishes and accompanying vegetables. The raw appetizers and side dishes complimented the meal for which, we ordered the Hamachi with kosho vinaigrette, peach, and olive and the Market Cucumber Salad. Both were fine, although not outstanding. Our favorite starter dish was the complimentary bread that was cooked on the grill and served with a spicy butter. From the grill, we ordered the Sizzling Flatiron Steak and the Mushroom with kombu dashi and tamari. The steak alone was a bit plain, but complimented by the chimichurri sauce was tasty. The mushrooms were the standout of the meal as the dashi and tamari created a sweet profile.","89 South St Pier 17 New York, NY 10038"
2023-07-16,2023-09-16,Momofuku Ssam Bar,"As longtime followers of David Chang and his Momofuku brand, when my wife and I traveled from California to NYC, I made a reservation to surprise her.  Upon arriving, we received a warm friendly greeting and were whisked away to a waiting elevator to our table.  Once seated, the staff were very attentive and friendly.  Checking the menu we decided on the fixed menu. $110pp with the additional  Super Saam option along with the wine paring option.  Starting with bubbles was great and we enjoyed the well dressed salad and flat bread with the strongly spiced compound butter, which set our expectations for the flavors to come. The oysters were tender and the accompanying sauce worked well, even if lacking balance. The rabini (broccoli rabe?) was good and the chili sauce was a great pairing however, the grilled asparagus, which was part of the upgrade, outshined it. The one thing on the asparagus:  it came with what was advertised as bernaise sauce however either the tarragon was missing so so subtle it was undetectable.  Better described as hollandaise sauce but still very tasty. Our left handed waiter/chef/sommelier  using right handed scissors struggled due to the scissors however was able to do what she needed to throughout the meal.  She was super friendly and knowledgeable about each wine she poured us as well as attentive to our water glasses. We left the first course and moved on to the prawns..the sauce was spicy and flavorful but the head on shrimp were slightly overcooked detracting from the  texture.  Now the to proteins...the short rib glazed with a simple honey soy glaze was perfection and paired wonderfully with the wine selection.  The flatiron steak, while cooked to a perfect medium rare lacked flavor, even salt and pepper, which made it very disappointing. It was tender and the wine paired well with it however the lack of flavor made this something I could do much better at home.  The pork shoulder appeared to be seasoned nicely before cooking so we were excited to have this but were again disappointed by the lack of flavor, if by design or not. The pork, while cooked perfectly did not have wow factor we were expecting.  The garlic soy rice appeared along with the cucumber salad.  Cucumber salad was as advertised as a cucumber salad, nothing special. The garlic soy rice, upon appearance looked very flavorful but upon taste, it was underwhelming and bland. The strawberry sorbet with lime zest paired well with the dessert wine and was refreshing and tart. Expecting to be wowed by this experience, we were not. That being said the simple sorbet served for dessert as a nod to the old Ssäm bar ""mochi from the Trader Joe's around the corner"" made me laugh and I actually appreciated that.  Or perhaps it was nod to Tossi's strawberry shortcake?Overall, we had a great time but the wine and service  were far better than the food.Notes for improvement:Left handed staff should be provided the tools they need (lefty kitchen shears exist we can sent you some!  We have a lefty in the family)Wine pairings are a glass of wine in California not a tasting. Apologies if that is different in New York and we are misunderstanding. But the sommelier referred to it as a tasting while the menu said it was a  pairing. These are two different things. $55 pp for a pairing is incredibly reasonable but for a tasting not so much.More flavor on the proteins. This was our biggest stumbling block for a higher review.","89 South St Pier 17 New York, NY 10038"
2023-07-15,2023-09-16,Momofuku Ssam Bar,"We came here for date night last night and ate in the dining room - absolutely loved it and cannot wait to return! We sat in the dining room and enjoyed a nice view of the city. The interior is polished but not stuffy, staff were super friendly and welcoming. The food was amazing. We got the set menu which turned out to be a very good decision! Every dish was so delicious - from the salad to the meats (seriously wow flavors!!). Hard to even say what was my favorite as everything was so good.The sauce for the prawns was one of the best tasting sauces I've ever had. The staff are clearly very skilled as they are the ones cooking in front of you (which I thought was such a cool clever rendition of traditional Korean bbq). Everything was charred perfectly and just the right amount of crispy and juicy at the same time.The broccoli rabe was a standout for me - i easily could have had it all to myself and not shared any with my husband. The short rib was my favorite of the 3 red meats but they were all good - I mean close your eyes mmmmm good.It was the perfect amount of food and I'd say for the quality and amount, $110 pp is a steal! I would add this place to my list of favorites in NYC!","89 South St Pier 17 New York, NY 10038"

Everything was ok, but not enough to say I'd return. The host/cook was a bit gruff. The protein doesn't come with the free small things an actual Korean BBQ place would give. Just a free grilled bread. I don't like the fact that there isn't a coat check. With a nearly $600 check, I don't want to have to sit on my coat. Also the menu leans too heavily on sesame seeds. I'll stick to Queens, even if the views aren't as pretty.","89 South St Pier 17 New York, NY 10038"

2023-05-02,2023-09-16,Momofuku Ssam Bar,"We went for dinner on a Monday night. Many items were no longer available as they had ""changed"" their menu and the selection was quite limited. We ordered the Grilled Prawns, Cacio e Pepe rice cakes and the Brussel Sprouts. Both the prawns and brussel sprouts were tasty, but the prawns were a bit mushy, maybe indicating a lack of freshness? The Cacio e Pepe rice cakes were bland, and when we mentioned it to the server to ask for more cheese (whom we later found out was the Manager!), he said, ""Oh I'm so sorrryyy, but I've never heard that before,"" and walked away. We were shocked at his condescending tone so when our waitress Linda came by, we told her about the incident and showed her the dish of the rice cakes. She could see a pool of oil in the bowl separated from the rice cakes and immediately apologized and took the dish back to show the chef as she said this shouldn't happen. Linda offered to take it off the bill and asked us if we wanted to order something else instead. This is how a ""Manager"" should interact with their customers regarding a complaint, but instead we felt dismissed. I wonder what David Chang would say to that.","89 South St Pier 17 New York, NY 10038"

While I've never had momofuku, I have heard it is overrated... and I guess my experience has confirmed that. The food was mediocre at best. Here are the items we ordered1. Skirt steak- tasted over cooked? Dry, and not tender at all.... Feel like I can make a better steak than this...2. Branzino- I liked this the most out of the few items we got... cuz you really can't go wrong with fish...it was lacking in the flavor department tho, and the salad had WAYYY too much dressing.... It's almost as if they put all the dressing for the fish onto the salad.... The fish in comparison didn't have much flavors3. Brussel sprouts- mediocre... the flavor is not there. I've tasted way better brussel sprouts at every other restaurant I've had.4. Roasted oysters (one of their most popular dish)- not good... couldn't really taste the oysters since it was overpowered by the crunch.Ambiance: very small indoor section, that only had bar seats and high bar tops. Most of the seats were outdoors.... And not ideal when the weather is chillyOverall verdict- save your money... you are paying for very subpar food that's overpriced... the food items were not cheap! Actually on the expensive side.","89 South St Pier 17 New York, NY 10038"

Pictures don't do it justice because you can't smell the food or see the true beauty of the dishes but yes it slaps. I had the house special beef noodles and house specifically dumplings. The noodles are thick af with the broth so I suggest having a drink or something to scarf it down but it's good.

I'm not sure. My friend ordered the Birria tacos - $17 for 2 which is a bit pricey - and then they were too spicy for her to eat. This was surprising because she has a high tolerance for spicy food. I ordered the chicken nachos - which looked appetizing - but the chicken tasted like it came out of a can. Not fresh, not good. Service was great and the guac was some of the best I've ever had!!

He (Rafa per receipt) just say sorry and proceeded to try go pressure us to stay for food and I said no, absolutely not- we have been waiting for 45 mins at this point and weren't acknowledged once. He then proceeded to give us a bill for the food where I said are you kidding, our food didn't come- not paying for that.

Only lame thing about this place is that the host tried creating fake hype on how sold out the restaurant was. They refused to give us a table despite several empty tables around. We took a place at the bar and the tables remained empty throughout. I think it's very silly of restaurants to do that, kills the good experience.Coming to the good part now. My cousin tried spicy skinny Mezcal for the first time and I think she is a life long fan. The bar tenders were amazing and friendly. We did a few repeats of the cocktail.We started with some delicious shrimp ceviche; the portion size was generous.Loved the snapper tacos however my absolute favorite was shrimp enchiladas.  This place serves authentic Mexican food and overall we had a lot of fun specially coz it does really have a fun and young vibe.

Their hours are a little wonky, because they can only store and produce so much food at a time, so it makes it pretty hard to snag a table or reservation time. They're known for their bun dau mam tom and serve it only on Friday - Sundays. On Mondays, they serve a different special menu item that changes almost every week.Almost everything in their bun dau mam tom is house made and a lot of items are sourced from Vietnam as well! Not a lot of places serve it here in NY, so I was so excited to see it being served here. Mam tom, or shrimp sauce, is a bit of an acquired taste and may not be for everyone, so they also serve this platter with some fish sauce as well. The entire platter comes with fried tofu (which they make themselves), blood sausage, grilled intenstines, vermicelli noodle blocks, grilled pork patties, pork belly and a plethora of herbs! Each bun dau is meant to be a single serving, but we comfortably finished 2 servings between 4 people. We also ordered some the surf clam salad and grilled snail sausage wrapped in betel as appetizers! For what it is, Mam is a little pricey (especially for Vietnamese street food), but a lot of their dishes are less common here in NY and they put a lot of labor into making some of their items in house!I felt like I was back in Vietnam when I was eating here. Their storefront resembles the food stall lined up on the streets of Vietnam. The small stool and low tables give you the exact dining experience you would have in Vietnam, but in New York instead!","70 Forsyth St New York, NY 10002"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Mắm,"Giving Mam, food & first dine-in experience a 3.5/5 with rooms for improvements. No bathroom. Friendly service but just awkward encounter with the staff.Before thinking of going, I'd highly recommend reserving a spot and making sure you know that's the dish you know and love already. They do these menu 'drops' (via hotplate, link on Instagram), and you'd get text notifications to reserve & pay for your meal in advance. Don't walk in as there's a chance you might get told no (happened to us before after we couldn't make it back quickly enough. We were told 45 min but got a call for a table after 10 min. At the time, we were already seated at the restaurant across the street with a light meal, hoping we'd make it back to Mam to try their dish of the day - the Clam dish. After about 45 min, we got back and were told 'no' by the male staff. We were pretty disappointed since we did make it our goal that day.)Then this time, I had a reservation. We were a bit early, but again, tiny space and we had to wait outside until our appointed time. A few walk-in parties got turned down because of the rain as they couldn't be able to do outdoor seating.Hu Tieu Nam Vang has most of the usual ingredients and flavors, not the best version nor favorite version I've had plus the bowls are in a smaller size than typical Viet noodle soup bowls. Okay portion for one person with an appetizer add-on. We didn't have appetizer options this day, only drinks. So for 2 bowls of Hu Tieu Nam Vang, fees, tax & tips - paid in advance), a tamarind drink, and a kumquat tea (paid after), in total, it was around $80 (see pic!). I'd be happy to support local businesses and do think Vietnamese food deserves a higher price tag, but it's got to have something nice and special. It doesn't make so much sense here at Mam to charge this kinda of price tag since the concept is street food dining outside (and if you're been to Vietnam, street food should be affordable aka for students or working people).Mam's menu and food presentation and execution have so much potentials, but the dining experience overall needs improvement. Right now, it just feels meh for NYC. I'll be the first in line if they move somewhere bigger, have a more solid team, and that I can be able to receive a streamlined service and sit comfortably.","70 Forsyth St New York, NY 10002"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Mắm,"Finally gave Mam a try while in the neighborhood, service was friendly.  We tried all of the appetizers on the menu and the main course that was special for the day which was the Bun Dau Mam Tom.  The snails sausages in and the chicken feet's were good, the eggplants and and raw clams salad was nothing special.  The special Bun Dau Mam Tom was nothing special, the flavors come from the dipping sauce which was fermented shrimp sauce very pungent.  We ordered a double orders as there were four of us, quite pricey for the amount and quality of food you get.  I would go back if there's a change in their menu.  We sat inside but they have seating outside their store front as well as across the street by the park to get the feel of eating in vietnam along the sidewalk.","70 Forsyth St New York, NY 10002"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Mắm,Our Vietnamese friend brought us there. The flavor is so special. Don't think I have had anything similar. I love anything that is authentic and happy we have this place in nyc!,"70 Forsyth St New York, NY 10002"
2023-08-27,2023-09-16,Mắm,"Very popular Vietnamese place on the lower east side. Small storefront with as many seats outside as in, including a line of small plastic tables just outside the Forsyth St park, across the street from the restaurant, with seating on very small low plastic no-back chairs. If you're a bit older (like me) they'll bring you a chair a little higher off the ground. Very creative drinks (non-alcohol), eg one with tamarind and peanuts. Foods which are presumably Vietnamese which I've never seen before, even in other Vietnamese restaurants, eg a dish with tofu chunks you dip in a hot shrimp paste sauce which when vigorously mixed turns from red to white. The dish includes grilled intestine and sausage but can be ordered and is fine without the meats. Overall, an experience, inexpensive too.","70 Forsyth St New York, NY 10002"
2023-08-23,2023-09-16,Mắm,Came here with my friend. We saw a video on insta about here. Was excited to try but sadly it was disappointing. The chicken feet appetizer is good but it's easy to make at home. We ordered two of them. The salad is meh. The $80 platter for two. Definitely not worth it. The chicken is dry without the sauce. With the sauce still very dry. The flavor is okay. The drinks are terrible. And the size for the price. In the platter for two. The soup was the best thing. Soup and chicken feet appetizer. It was very difficult to get the staff attention to order more things. I know it gets busy but y'all need more than one staff taking all the orders. It took a while to get their attention to order anything more than what we originally ordered on top of trying to get their attention for the check. There are people waiting. Adding up the wait times for things here and there will back up the next customers sitting down. I wish if I'm paying $80 for a thing to share it would be more than just noodle soup and dry chicken. You definitely leave here hungry if you do not order more things. I've seen a different menu online different times. Maybe this new menu just didn't hit the spot. I would love to come back and try it again with a different menu. But since the first experience wasn't that good. Not sure if I'll come back nor recommend here to friends. I would recommend the chicken feet and the soup. But the service and the price on top of everything else was not enjoyable. The table right next to the store. We had someone ask us to move so they can access something from the closed store. A little inconvenience. But the flavors are authentic. So I'm torn on coming back or not.The location they chose for a restaurant is too small. This size would be good for a bbt or coffee shop. But not a restaurant. Ive been to places where if the wait or line is too long. They will leave.,"70 Forsyth St New York, NY 10002"
2023-08-22,2023-09-16,Mắm,"We ordered raw surf clam salad, chicken feet and tamarind drink. I would skip the drink and spend that money on another appetizer or main. Really really love the flavors of the appetizer!!! Totally worth $12 each.It's really fun to sit outside and eat in the open space. There wasn't too much car traffic at all. Waiters are attentive but we were a bit confused if we needed to pay at the store front but the waiters will def pick up your bill at the stools.","70 Forsyth St New York, NY 10002"
2023-08-09,2023-09-16,Mắm,"A cute place to eat that reminds me of Vietnam. You can sit inside or outside. Inside is more regular seating, but outside dining is on plastic stools just like Vietnam. My friend and I ordered the Bun Dau Dac Biet, Cuon Diep, and Calamansi Tea.Beware that the Bun Dau Dac Biet might not be for the faint of heart because there is intestines and blood sausage. I'm not too adventurous but gave it a go. The intestines still had a ""flavor"" which I think means it could've been cleaned better...but I wasn't too keen on the texture of the blood sausage. Other than that, the rest of the platter was pretty good. The Calamansi Tea was overpriced in my opinion. It was $6 for what seemed like 10 oz of tea.Service was good, they were a bit busy, but accommodating. The food comes pretty quick once you order which is good. If you make a reservation, you have to order the platter.No bathrooms at the location, but the public restroom is across the st.","70 Forsyth St New York, NY 10002"
2023-08-04,2023-09-16,Mắm,Excellent experience for the 1st time ever we have had with such authentic Viet food. We drove almost 4 hrs to get there and all the foods were absolutely phenomenal. I hope they will grow and get known by more and more Viet foods lovers.,"70 Forsyth St New York, NY 10002"
2023-07-30,2023-09-16,Mắm,"Another overly hyped place in NYC. We had reservations but we were still told by the server to wait in the long line because apparently everyone in that line also had reservations. But after waiting in line for 15 minutes we find out from the host that most people in the line did not have reservations. So it was super confusing from the start. The host was nice and let us sit inside since we couldn't choose to be seated indoor our outdoors on our reservation, even though we had to pay for our main dish in advance.The food was a 3 at best. If everything was half the price it was sold at I would maybe give it a 4. But it's not. The dishes lacked seasoning, the fermented shrimp paste was good but got boring after 2 or 3 bites. The blood sausage needed salt and the snail wrap ($12 for 6 tiny wraps) tasted like chicken sausage. I would suggest giving your guests a variety of sauces instead of just one.Another big thing I noticed was the employees smoking by the outdoor seating area. And cigarette cartons on the shelf next to sauces in their open kitchen. I know this is a huge health hazard, so I looked for a health rating on the store front but could not find one. Which is a red flag.I would not recommend or return.","70 Forsyth St New York, NY 10002"

Maybe their medium is five fish balls?Curry sauce is very watered down. Made me really sadComplaint 2: pork was too pink (in bigbun and in siu mai) Maybe it was fully cooked and it is just pink. Maybe it was not fully cooked. Nothing a microwave cannot fix....but I would not go here after a drink or two because I cannot tell. It most certainly did look more cooked after microwavingComplaint 3: popcorn chicken could use a bit more flavor... msg or five spice powder would be much appreciated!Compliment: I do love their rice rolls.

2023-09-02,2023-09-16,5ive Spice,"I recently had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday at 5ive Spice, and it was an unforgettable culinary experience. The combination of Mexican and Vietnamese cuisine left my tastebuds delighted as the flavors actually complimented each other. For my visit, I ordered several dishes: Loaded Fries with Dip (side), 5ive Special (Pho), Shaking Beef (Vermicelli), and Beer Battered Fish Tacos.Foremost, the pho at this restaurant was truly exceptional. The broth was rich and savory with a pleasant hint of cinnamon. It came with plentiful slices of tender beef and a reasonably sized piece of boneless short rib. The short rib itself was cooked nicely and was topped with a delicious, tangy garnish. The size of the bowl is a bit on the smaller side when compared with other restaurants that serve an ""Extra Large Bowl"" option. However, it is important to note that the menu did not provide any sizing information for this item.The Loaded Fries was a delicious side. It came with several morsels of angus beef briskey and was seasoned with a blend of Mexican spices and Vietnamese sauces.Although the Shaking Beef was a fresh and savory dish, it was less appealing than the 5ive Special. The shredded pickled carrots and radish were delicious and added a nice texture to dish along with the lettuce and pickled mustard greens. However, the portion of the beef was a bit upsetting. The beef itself was tender and flavorful, but it seems that the amount of vegetables overwhelmed the dish.Lastly, the Beer Battered Fish Tacos was a mouthwatering fusion of Mexican and Vietnamese cuisine, as the flavors perfectly complimented each other. The tacos were served with a side of salsa and fish sauce. The tacos itself was topped with cilantro and shredded pickled carrots and radish. The flavor of this dish was truly distinctive, as it felt like I had taken a bite out of a ""breadless"" banh mi that was in the form of a taco. The fish was also well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Moreover, the taco shells (coconut rice crepe) also had a distinctive texture that really helped bind the dish together.Overall, the ambiance of the restaurant was also charming, with a nice modern, bar-like décor that created an inviting atmosphere. The service was also attentive and friendly, adding to the overall positive experience.In conclusion, this Vietnamese-Mexican fusion restaurant exceeded my expectations with its flavorful and delicious pho and creative fusion dishes. If you're looking for a culinary adventure that combines the best of both worlds, this place is a must-visit.P.S. Their bathroom is integrated with their shelf.

2023-05-28,2023-09-16,Wah Fung No 1,"i've been to this place a couple of times and find their BBQ meats a little inconsistent. the first time i tried it the BBQ pork (叉烧) was very sweet and tasty. the second time, the meat that i got was hard and the roasted pork (烧肉) was all bones. :(i do recommend this place however because the small portion is only $5-6 and you can get multiple types of meat! it would just depend on the time of day you order because they could sell out of the better meats and give you what's left over.this is a cash only and take out establishment, so be prepared!","79 Chrystie St New York, NY 10002"
2023-05-22,2023-09-16,Wah Fung No 1,"The best Asian bbq spot in Chinatown. There's a long line outside for a reason. Bring your cash. Order all the meat. It comes with rice and steamed vegetables. It's so tasty, flavorful, marinated to perfection. And the best part is that it's cheap and affordable. It's worth the hype on social media. The service is fast so even if the line is long and intimidating, you're out of there with a bag full of good Chinese bbq.","79 Chrystie St New York, NY 10002"
2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Kopitiam,"Overall rating: 4.1Unfortunately, I don't have any pictures of the food other than this shot. This was my first and maybe last time trying Malaysian food. The pictures on Google made it seem like this was a high end restaurant because they are so high quality.So I was a bit surprised & a bit turned off when I realized this is more of a cafe eatery, east village type place. Pay at the cashier, seat yourself, nyu, type place. I think I may have just had higher expectations, and that's my b.I can't fully remember what I had, but it was just okay. I'm not sure if the flavors just weren't for me. But I was missing a kick. I do want to try it again for brunch since that's when most of the reviews highlight.But I'm also conscious there's a chance I don't like Malaysian food. I'll have to try another restaurant and report back.","151 E Broadway New York, NY 10002"

2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Kopitiam,"Really wanted to love it :( the char kway teow was incredibly overpriced, especially for its small size and the fact that it took 25 mins. The taste of it was mediocre. The Kaya toast was the best thing there. Oh but the egg dip for the Kaya toast was an extra $4. The beef randang was dry and tough. The Hainanese chicken lacked flavor (and was 60% bone), as did the rice it came with. The Pan Mee depended on the anchovies for flavoring, and was otherwise bland. Also this place had no chili oil? I spent months in SE Asia so I came in looking for those flavors, ready to pay premium for authenticity, and this place didn't deliver despite the prices.Nice people, though, and the Milo drink was good!","151 E Broadway New York, NY 10002"
2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Kopitiam,"This is a no frills spot in the Lower East Side. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. You also have to bus your own table.I've never really had Malaysian food before, so this was a great, affordable way to try it! I got the nasi lemak, which was anchovies over coconut rice with a hard boiled egg. The rice had a subtle coconut flavor which nicely complimented the saltiness of the anchovies. The egg on top was just plainly hard boiled and wasn't anything special. It balanced the saltiness of the rest of the dish though. At first, I wasn't completely wow'ed by the dish, but I found myself craving it the next day.The Kaya Butter toast is a good way to finish the meal. It's not too sweet and the bread is light and airy.I would definitely come back to get the rice bowl again! Overall, it's a great affordable spot to check out.","151 E Broadway New York, NY 10002"

2023-09-05,2023-09-16,Kopitiam,"Super flavor! Thethe service was a bit slow, saw them serve other people who ordered before us...but the food itself was flavor! We got the nasi lemak (8/10), pandan chicken (7.5/10), tok tok mee (8/10), and the white coffee (7/10). The pandan chicken was just a whole blob of chicken, I thought it would have other things within it too, not too flavorful but the sweet chili sauce compliment it well. The main dishes were both very flavorful, you have to mix both well especially the tok tok mee where all the sauce is at the bottom. The white coffee was on the lighter side where you didn't really taste the coffee flavor and for my sweet tooth, I think I would've liked it sweeter and stronger","151 E Broadway New York, NY 10002"

I paid $38.11 for a noodle dish, two snacks and a coffee.Everyone that was there was ordering the Kaya butter toast (which I have yet to try!!)Here's what I got:Pan Mee dry noodles : I'd rate it 2/5 - the sauce flavor was flat to me. Salty and soy sauce like. I didn't finish them.Otak Otak : 4/5 - unique favor and presentation but very very smallPulut Panggang: 5/5 - good balance between salty shrimp paste and rice with a flavorful spicy sauce.Salted Bek-Kopi: 5/5 - salty and sweet coffee. Delicious.The menu is overwhelming and the guy at the register wasn't helpful with recommendations. So I just ordered a bunch of things and hoped for the best.

By making the reservation, we were given the chance to spin a wheel and got a free glass of wine, which was a cute welcoming touch.This gastropub does Korean tapas and some tasty drinks. I got myself a Lychee martini (their special that day) and the Rose queen with a little more syrup. It was awesome that they could alter the cocktail to fit your preferences - the sweeter rose queen was definitely more memorable for me personally.We order several tapas to share - crunchy tofu, bulgogi spicy rice cake with cheese (and we altered it to have no beef bc we had a vegetarian in our group), and the Crispy Pork steamed buns were phenomenal.Value wise, it definitely runs on the higher side especially with its Korean tapas concept.

The happy hour oysters were not properly chilled and two of them were dried out as if they had been sitting out after being shucked. The server asked me how they were and before I could reply, she smiled and walked away. My burger was overcooked and resembled a hockey puck. This is the height of tomato season, but the burger had unripe plum tomatoes. The bottom bun was soaked in grease. Again the server asked how it was, smiled and walked away before I could answer.  This burger cost $26.00, and was inedible. I won't go back.","35 Union Sq W New York, NY 10003"

I like the bar area as well, but fundamentally the service was incredible slow and detracting as a result.(Sashimi Bibimbap: 87.5% | B) - This is an interesting Japanese-Korean fusion dish that is reminiscent of a Chirashi bowl with Korean spices. The flavors are interesting, but I'm not quite convinced the bold flavors mesh well with what was a delicate dish.(Braised Short Ribs: 92.5% | A) - This is truly the definition of a hearty meal.

2023-09-06,2023-09-16,Little Kirin,"Was in a mood for a sandwich and this hit the spot for sure. As someone who has had authentic pho, I'm always skeptical when people try to do a fusion or get creative. I must say I was very impressed. When I took the first bite of the pho sandwich, I instantly tasted a bowl of pho. The sandwich is layered so well and packed with lots of beef. The beef was well cooked with delicious juices. The touch of the fried onions was perfect! I didn't get the broth, but now I wish I did. It most likely would have made the sandwich even better. Would love to come back and try other options. It's a very cute small shop with great taste in music. They guy who took my order was super friendly. I didn't have to wait long either.","81 St Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"

2023-08-29,2023-09-16,Little Kirin,"To be honest, I ended up feeling a bit let down by this experience. I had come across this place on Instagram and my expectations were quite high, but unfortunately, the sandwich didn't quite live up to the hype (specifically the pho short rib). The $20 price tag for the sandwich with broth felt quite steep, especially considering the overall experience. Waiting for over 20 minutes for my order didn't help matters. Although I appreciated the quality of the meat and the innovative concept, I found the bread of the sandwich to be a bit overpowering. It seemed to mask the flavors of the sauce and the meat. My main desire was for a bit more sauce, as I felt it was lacking that anticipated sweet kick.","81 St Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-23,2023-09-16,Little Kirin,Got the grandma braise pork rice to go. It was good but a lot of sauce so all you taste is the sauce they have on top. The pickle does make it nice and give it some freshness.,"81 St Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"

Intrigued by the Asian fusion menu, we opted for the short rib sandwich with pho broth and the loaded Kirin tots for lunch. Both were phenomenal. The substantial sandwich was packed--and packed with flavor! The pho broth was a wonderful accompaniment. I usually don't indulge in fried comfort foods, but the loaded tater tots, especially drizzled with sesame aioli, pickled red onions, and scallions, were so memorably delicious and an unexpected hit. We left very full, and still a good amount of tater tots as leftovers. This place is definitely worth a return visit.There was no AC on the day that we dined in, but it was still tolerable since it wasn't terribly hot that day, with some breeze entering from the open door.","81 St Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"

The only thing bringing it down is the speed of service.We were seated immediately without a reservation on a Sunday for dinner. The indoor tables were taken so we were seated under a covered outdoor patio, which had overhead fans and speakers for music. I loved the ambience the table lights created--super cozy. I would love to try sitting indoors next time though since it looked very nice in there as well.I ordered the Radicchio Salad and the Cacio e Pepe. Both were great! Loved the pine nuts and dressing that came with the salad. In addition, my pasta was cooked perfectly. It was a great balance of pepper and cheese. I also stole a couple of bites from my husband's dish, which was an eggplant baccheri pasta with pesto and tomato sauce. That was delicious as well, especially the sauce. I actually left feeling comfortably full--the portion size looks small but was good enough for me.I also appreciated that our placemats, bowls and silverware were cleared between the salad and our entrées. However, they forgot to give us silverware when our entrées arrived, and we waited maybe 15 minutes for someone to come with the card payment system (took a while to make eye contact with a server to indicate we were ready to pay). So the ending of our experience wasn't great, but again, the food was amazing and I would return for dinner.","211 Dekalb Ave Brooklyn, NY 11205"

I got the salmon toast and there was a fish bone in the salmon. The salmon toast I used to order from here had capers, it was much bigger, and had no fish bones.

Oddly enough they don't offer their lunch menu on the weekend...okay fine, but my friend wanted a drink from that menu and the waitress said no. Kinda weird, does that mean the bar can't make anything else if it's not on the brunch menu? Moving on, we also told our waitress we would start with the BLUEFIN TUNA TARTARE but it came out with our entrees (bummer). The quality of food made up for it though. The tartare was excellent, right amount of portion, citrus- everything! I ordered the PAPPARDELLE with oxtail, sooo good. A but heavy for brunch, I recommend skip apps if you get it.

2023-09-13,2023-09-16,Thai Diner,"Thai Diner is a gem nestled in the heart of New York City, and my recent dining experience there was nothing short of spectacular. From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted with warmth and a cozy atmosphere that set the tone for an unforgettable meal. This was especially needed, given that we had to wait over an hour to get in (they're primarily a walk-in restaurant)!The menu offered an enticing array of Thai-inspired dishes, and I couldn't resist trying the Thai Disco Fries and the Phat Bai Horapha. Let me tell you, these dishes were nothing short of perfection.The Thai Disco Fries were a revelation. A generous heap of crispy fries, smothered in a spicy Massaman Curry, adorned with red onions, peanuts, and coconut cream. The flavors danced in perfect harmony on my palate, and each bite was a delightful journey into Thai cuisine with a twist. The creamy coconut cream mellowed the fiery curry, creating a sublime balance of flavors and textures.Next up was the Phat Bai Horapha, and it was an absolute showstopper. Slices of tender steak were stir-fried to perfection with spicy chili, aromatic garlic, and Thai basil. The crowning glory was the crispy fried egg on top. The dish was a symphony of spicy, savory, and umami flavors that left me craving for more.What truly sets Thai Diner apart, apart from its incredible food, is the impeccable service. The staff was not only knowledgeable about the menu but also eager to ensure that every guest had a memorable experience. Their attention to detail and friendly demeanor added an extra layer of enjoyment to the meal.The ambiance at Thai Diner is a perfect blend of modernity and Thai charm. It's a place where you can have an intimate dinner or a lively get-together with friends, and it always feels just right.In conclusion, my visit to Thai Diner was a culinary journey that I won't soon forget. The Thai Disco Fries and Phat Bai Horapha were both exquisite and the overall dining experience was top-notch. If you're looking for authentic Thai flavors with a creative twist, combined with impeccable service and a welcoming atmosphere, Thai Diner is the place to be. I can't recommend it enough, and I can't wait to return for another flavorful adventure.","186 Mott St New York, NY 10012"

Service was fast and friendly, but the food left more to be desired. Portion sizes were a bit small for both the lobster omelet and pad thai given the higher price points. The flavors were well-done and complex, but I ended up having to stop by a bodega afterwards to really feel satisfied. While the ambience was top-notch, and the drinks were good, it felt more like tapas than a full restaurant. Perhaps I'll come back in the future, but many places exist in the UES and UWS that are half the price for a significantly larger portion. Given that Thai food is a dime a dozen in NYC, the flare of this place is really just its proximity to Chinatown.","186 Mott St New York, NY 10012"

2023-09-05,2023-09-16,Thai Diner,"I've been to Thai Diner twice now -- once for dinner on Friday and once for brunch on Saturday! Both times we got seated right away without a reservation because we were only 2 people. We did see larger groups waiting for a table. The place itself is pretty large -- there are outdoor seats, semi-outdoor seats and then an indoor section.We ordered the following:- Thai Diner Egg Sandwich (4/5). Really tasty with great flavors. The roti is very thin though so the sandwich unravels pretty fast.- Stuffed Cabbage Tom Khaa (4/5). Loved the coconut milk and cabbage. Wish there was a bit more umami or saltiness in the roll, but overall delicious. A bit disappointed that there were only 3 rolls.- Uncle Boon's Crab Fried Rice (5/5). I really liked this fried rice because I'm a huge fan of cilantro!","186 Mott St New York, NY 10012"
2023-09-04,2023-09-16,Thai Diner,"This place was everything I wanted and more. Often times places like this are super overrated to me. Not Thai diner. Omg. I don't even know where to begin. Food? 10/10. Drinks? 10/10. Service? 10/10. The classic diner style inside with the Thai decor was 10/10.Dishes we ordered (6 people):- 2 orders of Thai fries (maybe my fave dish. The crinkle cut fries with that sauce were ‍'s)- the massaman beef (v tender beef soooo good)- Kao soi with chicken (one of my favorite Thai dishes of all time that I can't always find at Thai restaurants; 10/10)- phat see ew with chicken (fat noodles, full of flavor)- uncle boon's crab fried rice (omggggggg SO MUCH CRAB FRIED RICE )- spicy green curry with sea scallops (excellent spice, scallops cooked perfectly)- pea shoots (side)- sticky rice (side)Drinks ordered:- thai iced tea (deelish, not too sweet)- golden tiger ya dong shots (a little intense/bitter but fun)- spicy tamarind Margarita (excellent flavor)I cannot wait come back on my next New York visit from the Bay AreaPer usual I took no pictures.

2023-08-28,2023-09-16,886,"Clubby atmosphere that's a great stop for drinks and snacks. We ordered:grass jelly sake ($23) - 3/5. This came in a small carafe and was refreshing but a bit too sweet. I would've liked more alcohol, less syrup. But it was nice to get grass jelly at the bottom of my drink!Honey glazed popcorn chicken ($13) - 4/5. I don't think this dish needs the glaze at all, which is too unctuous and sweet. The chicken itself is fried to perfection, though it comes in huge pieces. If it was smaller, it would make it more snackable.Pickled cucumber salad ($8) - 4/5. Once again, the cucumbers in this were huge, almost meaty. I think the pickle flavor was perfect, though having the cucumbers so big meant you got punched with vinegar when you bit into one.Hakka stir fry ($15) - 2/5. This is a pretty average stir fry. The sauce was a bit too salty, but there was a good mix of bean curd, meat, and veggies.","26 Saint Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"

2023-08-16,2023-09-16,886,"Great food every time I've been. I love the tofu here, it's cooked perfectly and the sauce is delicious. It's usually pretty busy but the wait is typically not longer than 10-15 minutes if there is one.","26 Saint Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-15,2023-09-16,886,"Great no frills type Taiwanese restaurant in St. Marks. Just basic tables, good music, and a good time.Staff was very friendly and explained a few of the dishes that were personally new to me.The railroad layout of the restaurant did mean that sound carries. If someone is loud, you will hear them and think the place is loud. It is not a quiet restaurant by any means.The back of the restaurant needs a little bit of an aesthetic facelift if you ask me. Bathroom in the way way back is nice though.We ordered the following:Chicken thigh sandwich - good flavor, but too many toppings that more than offset the flavor of the chicken. Wish the inside of the chicken thigh was a tad more cookedFly's head - very good and very different. Amazing flavor and probably my favorite thingScallion pancake beef burrito - unique and very tasty. Highly recommend orderingPork fried rice - ample amount of meat and fried egg.

We had to ask again, but it took a while since our waitress was not really checking in on us.The Notorious TFC was a glorious sandwich though, so I would probably return just for that.","26 Saint Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"
2023-07-29,2023-09-16,886,My friends and I decided to try this place because we saw it on social media and it lived up to the hype!Expect a short wait if it's the dinner rush time. I thought the sausage fried rice alone could've been a whole meal but we also got to try the fried chicken poppers and the bulgogi (a table favorite).I recommend the table split the larger format drink options. We got two of the lychee drinks for the table to share.Don't expect a super fancy date night vibe. It's a trendy spot to meet up with a couple of friends.,"26 Saint Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"

2023-07-23,2023-09-16,886,"Great food, it's improved a lot since the last time I was here. We also got the popcorn chicken, three cup chicken, and sesame noodles. The scallion pancake with beef and Taiwanese sausage fried rice were my favorites. The indoor space is a little crowded and not great for big groups so we sat outside. Also ordered sake bombs with flavored beer and they were delicious. Food is just slightly salty but good for just a casual hangout.","26 Saint Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"

Even to go it was a still fresh and delectable.The Dan Dan noodles had soft and bouncy noodles that were complimented with little crisp and peanuts.

Had a nice conversation about the neighborhood and his well-chosen songlist filling the old brick interior. Enjoyed my visit so much I brought my daughter with me the next night, where he handled us and a bigger crowd there to watch the game as efficiently as the night before.

The upstairs was closed off for an event.  We got the fish and chips and chicken tenders and to our surprise it was excellent. Fries are perfectly golden and crispy. Chicken tenders were juicy and crisp, served with three sauces. The batter was a little more seasoned than I preferred but still good, the fish was also less flakey than I am used to for cod but still good none the less. The tarter sauce was excellent. I would definitely come back a nice casual place by the pier to hang out with friends or get drinks.","22 Peck Slip New York, NY 10038"

2022-07-14,2023-09-16,The Hideaway Seaport,"I've been in Seaport for a few months now. An old hospitality veteran of NYC took me to Hideaway Seaport, insisting it was one of his favourite hangout bars. It didn't take me long to figure out why. The staff, from Mike and Ruth to Cam and Evelyn (and the rest of the gang) put in a huge effort to make me and the rest of the guests feel at home. Lots of smiles all around. They did a bang up job of introducing me to the neighborhood, and the many new neighbors that kept coming back over and over to this bar to shoot the breeze. Also, they have Imperial Beers. Nothing more a guy fresh from London could ask for. 10/10 staff, 10/10 drinks, 10/10 atmosphere. Will be returning many, many times.","22 Peck Slip New York, NY 10038"

I had a vegetable couscous the first time we went that was delicious, but have found everything we've had since to be incredibly salty (even the salads). The burger is probably the most reliable choice. We will probably just go for drinks from now on.","66 Hicks St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2022-05-25,2023-09-16,Ingas Bar,Cozy spot with incredible food and wine. We live down the street and have been wanting to try this place since it opened. Got a table for two around 9pm on a Thursday. I'm a vegetarian and ordered the couscous - I didn't have high expectations for couscous and vegetables but it was one of the most amazing dishes I've ever had in my life. I already want to go back and get it again. My partner got the burger and celery salad - both delicious. The orange wine recommended but our server was also the perfect pairing. We can't wait to go back!,"66 Hicks St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

I don't think it's been hit with some negative reviews because people had unfairly high expectations due to the NY times review, but I think it's a great neighborhood spot with good food. The service was nice. We had the hangar steak and a fish, both were pretty good. What definitely come back again. Wish they had a website and menu posted, annoying that restaurants don't want to provide that basic info anymore...","66 Hicks St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-08-15,2023-09-16,Ingas Bar,"Side note: Menu is from one of their Instagram posts. It might be updated now with higher prices and different dishes.Anyway, I'm not sure if I ordered the wrong dishes or something but I didn't exactly have an experience matching a lot of other reviewers. The staff here was friendly whether it was the bartender or the waitstaff and the atmosphere was nice playing mostly pretty quiet indie music. To drink I got Otto's Negroni with vaguely lists gin, aperitif, and vermouths which was $15 though I was tempted to order the Lovers Rock. I asked what was in it making sure that this wasn't using some type of overly sweet vermouth or aperitif and they said the ingredients and that it was on the bitter end with a touch of sweetness with some orange flavor. Satisfied with the response, I ordered it and it was tasty and exactly as described. I'm not sure why the menu doesn't list the ingredients but it was tasty so whatever.To start out with, I got a Shrimp Salad (don't remember the exact name) which I presume was something around $16. It was served with I think 5/6 raw shrimp, mayo, lettuce, crackers, and lemon. The shrimp were plump but not sweet and the mayo sauce was very light and it was overall bland and not worth it with the presumably Ritz crackers didn't exactly help either. I don't see the dish on the menu anymore which I kind of don't mind as I wouldn't recommend ordering it anyway.I partially went here as I wanted to try another burger in the area having been to Henry Public enough times. The Cheeseburger which was $20 or $21 was served with pickles, onions, and mayo. It was the same price as the Henry Public one with cheese though the cheese here was American which I definitely don't prefer. While I found it juicier compared to that spot, it was definitely a lot smaller, the bun was worse, and the fries were worse both less crispy and overly salted. The pickles were standard. The burger was...alright but not as good overall.I don't exactly get the reviews here outside of perhaps people being happy that the chef opened up a new restaurant. While I liked my cocktail and found it reasonably priced, the appetizer was pretty terrible and the burger wasn't anything better than the local spot and in many ways worse. They have some interesting Italian influenced dishes which might be a bit better and I likely should have gotten the Celery Victory over the shrimp but it would take a good amount of convincing for me to come back there otherwise. Low 3/upper 2.","66 Hicks St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

We were happy to find two spots at the bar, though when the bartender snapped at me for asking for a menu after she asked if we'd be eating, then handed me a drink and not a food menu, we stood up and walked out. Shocking that a server whose income depends on the quality of service they provide thinks it's okay to treat customers so rudely. No thanks. I'll go and drop $100 on dinner elsewhere.","66 Hicks St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-06-23,2023-09-16,Ingas Bar,"I've tried this place three times now, as everyone in the neighborhood seems to love it I couldn't figure out why I didn't. The first time my friend and I came we couldn't even find something on the menu that sounded remotely appealing, so we left after, albeit , a delicious cocktail. It was quite loud in the bar area which is open into the dining room. Second time I went with a friend from out of town and were just as unimpressed with the brunch menu, very few options, staff wasn't very warm and drinks were taken away while not even being finished. This 3rd (and last) time I ended up actually sending my food back -the salad was literally a pile of wet lettuce,  a sprinkle of mint and no other vegetables and a thin consistency flavorless dressing. For $17, I tried to eat it and couldn't even, it was so bland. So I sent it back. My dinner ended up being a side of fries, which is the only good thing on the menu, which is the size of a ""specials menu"" --I'm done trying, I'm glad others love it but it's just not for me.","66 Hicks St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-05-23,2023-09-16,Ingas Bar,"We were so pleased to have another restaurant open up in the same space after Jack the Horse left. We live nearby and anticipated dining at Inga's Bar frequently....unfortunately we're not going to because of the limited menu options as well as the skimpy portions for the value...overpriced for tapas plate-sizes. The ""stew"" was a soup with a few bits of meat...the meager pieces of bread were hacked into uneven  shapes which I used to soak up the liquid. The fish entree was toddler portion and not memorable. The service was okay even though we had a reservation. The ambiance is noisy like many places of its ilk.But we're content in dining at a longtime restaurant down on Henry Street which offers great food and staff...we can also enjoy a normal conversation decibel level.Even though ours is only one of a handful of patronages that doesn't matter when stacked against the numerous 5 star ratings, we hope the powers that be will make improvements.","66 Hicks St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

The salmon was good and the latkes were ok, little bit of salmon roe along with the sour cream was a nice addition to the texture. The greens with it were bitter and I don't think they complemented it well. Service was great and the space is so beautiful that I'm sure it's a nice place for a drink, but the food was just not all too dazzling for the price.

A friend and I ended up here somewhat randomly, just thinking we wanted Thai food, but despite our initial concerns about how crowded it was and how close together the tables were it turned out to be a really lovely experience. I had eggplant basil, which was both attractive and delicious, while my friend had pad see ew. Best of all, though, was the service, friendly and unobtrusive and perfectly timed. We always had enough water, and the moment I accidentally dropped my spoon, someone was there promising to bring me a new one, and he then showed up with it within 30 seconds. At the end, I forgot my umbrella and didn't realize it, but by the time we were downstairs from our upstairs table and headed for the door, a server had found it and dashed down to hand it to me before I could leave...this truly amazed me. I've really never had such amazing service at a restaurant, so I thought this place was deserving of an excellent review.","5 E 19th St G Floor New York, NY 10003"

2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Uluh,Would highly recommend! Delicious food and service. Loved the crab tofu and pepper beef. The palate cleanser dessert we got was also lovely -- the rose lychee panda cotta. Of course the soul dumplings are a must,"152 2nd Ave Ste A New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-13,2023-09-16,Uluh,"Food was waaaay tooooo salty, like they doubled seasoned. I packed it to-go. Once I got home, I rinsed it with water.","152 2nd Ave Ste A New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-09,2023-09-16,Uluh,Probably my favorite Chinese place in manhattan!! The interior is beautiful and all the food is presented amazingly with great lighting haha. All the food has punches of flavor and can't go wrong with any dishes,"152 2nd Ave Ste A New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-04,2023-09-16,Uluh,"Amazing spot for authentic Szechuan! As a group of five, we ordered quite a few of the menu items and were surprised to be so full with a 1/3 of the bill we expected to receive. Everything was delicious and the Mapo tofu was a favorite for me. Very cute and great for larger groups as well. Wonderful service & quick to accommodate without any reservations needed. Can't wait to come back!","152 2nd Ave Ste A New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Uluh,This restaurant is everything! I always like to judge a restaurant based on the bathroom and this one had heated seats - incredible.Brought my mom who was visiting here for some elevated Chinese food. We were that hungry so we split an entree and an app which was the perfect amount of food.The shrimp rice cake in truffle sauce was unlike anything I've had before and it was so flavorful. This is a must! The mix of chewy rice cake texture with with al dente shrimp covered in a truffle oil sauce is immaculate.The fried crispy pork was sprinkled in a mild spicy seasoning which was tasty but honestly you can skip this. It's nothing special.The staff was so attentive and filled my water up every-time it was below half without me asking. We also were there around 2pm on a Friday so it wasn't that crowded but still busy for that time of day.The prices are a bit higher but it's really good food!,"152 2nd Ave Ste A New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Uluh,"I came on a weekday around 6:15. I had called ahead of time to see if I could book a reservation but they don't take reservations after 6 PM. A lot of people start trickling in after 6:30-7, the restaurant was pretty full so something to keep in mind. They have a waitlist system post 6 PM where they'll text you once your table's almost ready.My party of 5 sat indoors and the interior looks beautiful. We ordered 2 appetizers and 4 entrees which was plenty for us.Woodear mushroom salad - well liked, chilled and refreshing, slightly spicySautéed pea shoots - garlicky, seasoned nicely, a great vegetable dishCrab tofu - a favorite among the table, really big and white rice is a must to go with the sauce1/2 Peking duck - came with the thin crepe pancake wraps, crispy skin and meat was already removed off the bone so we didn't need to do any of that, also a favorite among the table and probably the best Peking duck I've had in a long timeDan Dan noodles - usually spicy but this wasn't spicy, pretty goodFish with pickled cabbage - HUGE, lots of noodles, vegetables and fish, sour and spicy, didn't really like it compared to the other dishes but that's just my personal preference (was a little too sour for me but it's pickled cabbage so I knew this was to be expected. Everyone else liked it though)Mango pomelo sago juice - huge drink in a tall glass, essentially a mango smoothie with mango and pomelo bits and sago pearls. This was REALLY good and refreshing, the fresh mango really stood out.Stand out dishes were definitely the crab tofu and Peking duck. I'd consider those must-order dishes for anyone who goes. I'd get the mango pomelo sago juice again too. We were very full and I'd definitely come back again. Dishes are a little pricey but the service and quality of the food live up to the price tag. I will be back!","152 2nd Ave Ste A New York, NY 10003"

2023-08-29,2023-09-16,Uluh,"After hearing amazing things about this spot, I was super excited to try it! I came with a group of 7 at around 6:30 PM. We had to wait around an hour for a table. However, I'd say the wait was worth it. We ordered a ton of dishes:- sweet and sour pork ribs: one of my faves tonight- tripe in chili oil- sour and spicy fish- beef fried rice- pumpkin crispy balls? I thought these were super yummy and this dish was actually recommended to me but not everyone liked them :(- half duck- szechuan chili chicken: also a fave- soup dumplingsOverall the bill came to around $35 per person. I would definitely recommend this spot!","152 2nd Ave Ste A New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Uluh,"I'm writing this review for the spicy fish in pickled cabbage soup only. This is the best soup I have ever had in my life by far. It is incredibly flavorful, pungent, spicy, it makes my mouth water and satisfies a craving. The fish is so flaky and delicious, the cabbage is crunchy and pickled and yummy, the mushrooms are impeccable. I order it for takeout pretty often and it's just as good as in person. They package it wonderfully and the leftovers are incredible. THANK YOU ULUH for blessing my taste buds !!!!!","152 2nd Ave Ste A New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-27,2023-09-16,Uluh,"Wow Wow Wow! The crab tofu was a hit! I've been meaning to try this spot, but decided to just order it via delivery and I was not dissapointed. The crab tofu had a generous amount of crab, and tasted absolutely wonderful as a compliment to the tofu. I highly recommend that you order this! The spicy soup dumplings were good too! I will be coming back to dine in!","152 2nd Ave Ste A New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Very Fresh Noodles,"Food was so good, I told my girlfriend not to talk to me for 5 minutes so I can dwell on the flavors that I just experienced.The service was great. The employees were friendly and made you feel like you made the right decision by standing in their line. We had the pleasure of having an employee come to us while we were standing off to the side and come tell us about the menu and it was the best thing that coulda happened. He came up and said, ""Everything on the menu is good. Thank god"" and he wasn't wrong. He recommended the lamb noodles dry and the beef noodles in the soup and it was the right call.Definitely come here and enjoy the the market but either on the way out, or way in, enjoy the very fresh noodles that are getting smacked on the table in front of you behind the glass. And then let them smack your tastebuds.","409 W 15th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Very Fresh Noodles,"WOW. The Chelsea Market was recommended to me as a must stop place to for my NYC trip and did NOT disappoint! There are many vendors at the market but the glowing lights, line to order and ambiance of Very Fresh Noodles caught our eyes immediately.Standing in line to order, we were approached by one of the workers, asking if it was our first time here and recommending some dishes ""everything is good, thank god"" - in his words. We ordered the lamb dry noodles,  Taiwanese beef noodle soup, Chicken wings and Smashed Cucumber.There is limited seating but after a short 15-20 min wait we were able to sit at the booth before our order was ready and watch them make the noodles and meals behind the glass. We thoroughly enjoyed both of our meals, the flavors were rich, meats were perfectly tender and the noodles were, as the title states, very fresh. Its been 5 hours since I've eaten there and I'm still processing how amazing the food was.The service was amazing, very attentive and employees show true care for the customers. Seriously one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while, would 100% recommend!","409 W 15th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Very Fresh Noodles,"This place was right inside the Chelsea Market and as expected, it took a bit of time before you are able to order and get your food. On top of that, the seating is very limited so prepared to look for a free table elsewhere. Other than that, the signage was actually very cute and there was an bar space with a view to the kitchen where you can see them slapping the noodles on the counter!! The noodles were very nicely made and had a great texture. The soup was a bit salty so expect to dilute it down with water if you prefer less salt. The disappointment was the cucumber. This is because the cucumbers were not crunchy such as ones made with Persian cucumbers. Without the crunchiness, the dish loses an important aspect of smashed cucumbers.One thing that they did well was that they wrap the food very well with 2 layers to prevent your soup from spilling so this would be a good one to deliver with no fears of spilling! It's worth a try but it wouldn't be a usual spot for me since it's inside the Chelsea market.","409 W 15th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-09-02,2023-09-16,Very Fresh Noodles,"The noodles! It's a must try! I love beef soups and this was delicious! The vegan Dan Dan noodles were perfect if you didn't feel like a soup, I wish we had grabbed the other vegan option just to try. We arrived literally minutes before the crowd around 4:40ish and we were able to snag two counter seats. I would highly recommend this place but given that it's in a market, be flexible and ready to wait, it'll be well worth it!","409 W 15th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-08-27,2023-09-16,Very Fresh Noodles,One of my favorite noodle spots. Quality is really good and taste fresh. There's always a line but usually don't wait too long.,"409 W 15th St New York, NY 10011"

2023-08-14,2023-09-16,Very Fresh Noodles,It's not my favorite noodle place to be honest. The noodle never feel cooked. Maybe it's just not the right food for me. Super spicy noodle doesn't taste spicy at all. Note I'm used to spicy food. So I couldn't like their spicy noodle at all. Usually the waiting line is super long. You'll have to wait like 20 mins during weekends. Not a lot of seating area is available. So sometimes I saw people stand and eating. I'm not a big fan of this place.Lamp noodle taste too greasy that I'm about to puke. I wouldn't come back again.,"409 W 15th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-08-13,2023-09-16,Very Fresh Noodles,It's at a corner of Chelsea Market. Not an appealing counter by just walking by but would wonder why there's a long line of people waiting to order. Tried the Taiwanese beef noodle and it's totally worth the 20 minutes line and waiting.,"409 W 15th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-08-12,2023-09-16,Very Fresh Noodles,"This stall is super busy. You can watch the noodle master prepping the fresh noodles. I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodles. This bowl of noodles was fresh. Unfortunately I didn't find the soup as flavourful as I remember eating Taiwanese beef noodles. The soup was salty and spicy, it reminded me of instant beef ramen soup. A bowl of noodles is also quite pricey for  what you get. This is a nice place to experience the hustle and bustle of Chelsea market.","409 W 15th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-08-12,2023-09-16,Very Fresh Noodles,Love it! Must try. Good breakfast. I will definitely come back. It's inside Chelsea Market.,"409 W 15th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,High Lúa Vietnamese Kitchen,"Food:High Lua keeps it simple, in terms of pho they only have beef, chicken, veg, and bun bo hue. We had the beef Pho and it was lovely. Great broth, wide noodles (which seemed to be dried?), and solid meat quality. The beef slices were clearly fresh and didn't have the holographic veneer usually present in pho meat. Also really enjoyed the iced coffee which was very strong but well balanced by a good amount of condensed milk.Service:Friendly staff and quick turn around on orders.Ambience:Casual, dimly lit, nicely air conditioned. Great place to meet up with friends or on a date.","182 S 2nd St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

2023-06-30,2023-09-16,High Lúa Vietnamese Kitchen,"In search of a good vietnamese restaurant in New york and this spot might be it. I love the vietnamese decor. The decorations were nostalgic. Played legit vietnamese msuic. They have this popular vietnamese that's not sriracha called chin-su. I got a bun bo hue with no spicy sate. I know that sounds bad. But I couldn't have any spice for a bit. I didn't expect a large beef rib to sit on top of the bowl, and on top of that there was still lots of meat placed in the bowl! It would have been nice to have more veggies. The noodles were a bit clumped together and was bi colored. Not sure what was going on there. The broth was good. It just lacked the lemongrass and fermented shrimp paste flavor that bun bo hue would normally have. The other two friends I was with gor banh mi and they really enjoyed it. Nice crunch balance with the fluffiness of the inside.The service was great. The server was very attentive. We were there for a while talking and they didn't push for us to leave.","182 S 2nd St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-06-12,2023-09-16,High Lúa Vietnamese Kitchen,"I came here with my friend on a Monday night for dinner. I ordered the papaya salad and added fried tofu. It was delicious!

Despite being busy with a lot of take-out orders, the staff were attentive and nice. We had a wonderful time!","182 S 2nd St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-06-11,2023-09-16,High Lúa Vietnamese Kitchen,"Viet food is one of the few cuisines in NYC that is lacking. High Lua in Williamsburg is a pretty solid option, and is one of the few Viet restaurants in the area. The Banh mi and pho were overall quite decent, nothing too amazing but can't really complain either! Good service and cute atmosphere.","182 S 2nd St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-06-08,2023-09-16,High Lúa Vietnamese Kitchen,"This place has been on my list for a while and I'm so glad I got to try it. I ordered the grilled pork with rice, and I was both surprised by the generous portion and also how beautifully it was plated. The food was flavorful and delicious. I loved how the rice was topped with roasted garlic and the roasted garlic oil. My one gripe is that some of the pork was a bit grisly , which made it a bit chewy but otherwise it had great flavor and smoke. I still think about that meal a lot, and am excited to return to have it again.","182 S 2nd St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-06-04,2023-09-16,High Lúa Vietnamese Kitchen,Tiny portions for Vietnamese food. I've had Vietnamese food all my life and have literally never seen pho portioned this size. We both ordered the main pho entree for dinner and needed to supplement with other food.,"182 S 2nd St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-06-02,2023-09-16,High Lúa Vietnamese Kitchen,"If you come here DO NOT get the pho. Get the turmeric chicken instead.Their pho was extremely disappointing -- the noodles didn't have good texture, there was no depth to the broth (it kinda tasted like soy sauce water), and they are not generous with the amount of meat.Their turmeric chicken on the other hand was very good. The skin was crispy, it was very flavorful, and portioning was good.Service was great and the ambiance was fine. I would give it a 3 1/2 star rating if I could. I might come back to try other items on the menu but definitely will not be getting pho again.","182 S 2nd St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,The Little Pig,"Ambiance - was a chill relaxing place. We sat indoors by the front window.Service - there was one lady (very nice lady) behind the bar taking care of everyone so she was falling behind. Service was still okay but just a bit slow when you needed something. Another hiccup was when we finally got the bill, their network wasn't working so we had to wait longer to pay. Then when we finally got the card to go through, she billed us for the wrong amount which caused another delay.Food- The crispy ravioli was mediocre. Flavor wasn't there and it only had a little cheese inside. Wasn't a fan of it.- Both sandwiches were excellent. The Italian sandwich was deceptively large and filling while the fries that came with the Italian pork belly sandwich was exceptional. I'd say it outshines McD fries (what I consider the gold standard of regular fries). It was seasoned perfectly and had a good fresh crisp to it. Not a single soggy one in the bunch either.","497 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-09-01,2023-09-16,The Little Pig,This place is small and unassuming. I brought some friends here to check it out and all three of us were very impressed by the quality of their food.

2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Forma Pasta Factory,"Affordable and cute casual pasta spot in the middle of Fort Greene! We came here on a warm Wednesday night and was surprised at how crowded it was. There was a line to order the food and also a ""line"" to find a seat hahaI love this fast casual pasta concept and it reminded me of some of the restaurants in Italy. Doing this allows the prices to be more affordable than a regular sit down Italian restaurant. There were three seating areas a couple of outdoor seats in front of the restaurant, inside, and then in the backyard patio. We were able to snag a seat in the backyard just in time when our food came. My only complain is I wish the staff would do a better job in making sure people have seats before the food came such as not letting people hold seats before they order. We saw some people sitting and waiting for their parties to order and other with food coming already waiting for seats to open up. By the time we finished eating the people sitting and waiting were still waiting for their party to order!Moving on to the food, we ordered three items and was provided free bread. We ordered the shrimp pasta, pesto pasta and meatballs. They were all tasty but our favorite was def the shrimp pasta it had a lot of flavor. We were both very full after the meal. Will come back to try some of their specials and maybe have a glass of wine next time as they have a pasta + wine for $18 deal.","5 Greene Ave Brooklyn, NY 11238"

They are also flexible with vegan options!,"5 Greene Ave Brooklyn, NY 11238"
2023-09-04,2023-09-16,Forma Pasta Factory,"It's 3.5 rounded to 4. Pastas were really al dente, but on the salty side. Same was the meatball. I did enjoy the side order cauliflower and the panna cotta. Orders came out a bit slow. They have more tables in the backyard if you can't find tables inside. It's such a humid day today that we're drenched in sweat while eating in the backyard. Wish they can put up some fans there.","5 Greene Ave Brooklyn, NY 11238"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Forma Pasta Factory,This place was so good! I had heard so much about it and was really excited to finally try it. I honestly still can't believe they have $13 pastas because the portion was really good and the pasta itself had great flavor. I tried the pomodoro and would definitely recommend! The pasta was perfectly al dente. The people working were all super sweet.,"5 Greene Ave Brooklyn, NY 11238"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Forma Pasta Factory,"I cannot wait to come back and try the rest of the menu. Came here on a Saturday evening, between the delivery guys and other people waiting outside for friends, I could immediately tell this place was a staple spot for those who live around here.Once inside you order at the counter and grab your tray and number and find a seat. Depending on the time you visit seats are high in demand. Good thing there is an inside with tables and bar tops as well as the backyard patio which I'm sure is great on an evening.Everything after ordering is self serve, grab your extra napkin and water refills at the back counter and wait for the magic to happen. They have an open kitchen so you get a front row to the organized machine of cooks tossing together the best plates of pasta.We orders the Pipette Ragu and the Saturday special. Both dishes were affordable between $13-$16, the Ragu had special pairing with a glass of wine for $18. You really can't beat that type of luxury in this city. The Saturday special was delicious, short rib was so tender. I would have preferred a different pasta pairing, but would eat again in a heart beat. Dishes were a great portion and the variety makes it a great option to share and try all their pastas. Last but not least the focaccia that came with every plate was soft (a little cold) and the perfect pairing to soak up extra sauce. This place is great, affordable, and has something for everyone.","5 Greene Ave Brooklyn, NY 11238"

2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Forma Pasta Factory,"Loved everything about this place. It does get packed, but they're quick. We got lucky and were able to get a seat outside in the back. Such a cute back patio. I got the pipette ragu and arancini, which I've never had before. The arancini were nice bite-size appetizers packed with great flavors and crisp. The white sauce ragu was delicious! The right amount of pasta leaves you satisfied and not overly full. It wasn't too saucy and the pasta was cooked with the right amount of firmness. I enjoyed the sauce so much that I used the bread they gave me to scoop up the remainder of the sauce.","5 Greene Ave Brooklyn, NY 11238"
2023-08-23,2023-09-16,Bread & Spread,"A must whenever I'm in NYC, especially the Porchetta! So rich and decadent and a wonderful delight. The cast iron chicken is also great (and not as rich and heavy as the porchetta), and I also love the Giardino. Unfortunately I have yet to try any of their bánh mì, mostly because I always go back to my faves.The interior is small and can get warm (especially on hotter days), but honestly these sandwiches are made to be taken on the go and eaten at a park or by the water. The service is quick and straightforward, which means you're in and out and ready to go enjoy your food.Honestly, this place have never done me wrong.

He is convinced they are the best sandwich shop in New York. When we lived in CA, he talked about them. Since coming back to NY, he talks about them. I have to bring him back soon. Very soon. I agree with him too. Their sandwiches are special. You feel they are made with love and care. Every element of their sandwiches compliment each other so well.  Ahh, and their blackberry jam. That blackberry jam with beef short rib. Brilliant.","151 Front St Dumbo, NY 11201"

Between the incredible food, outstanding service, and tremendous value, this is one of my new favorite restaurants in NYC. All the food was excellent but the standouts for us were the seoulsbury steak, mushroom bibimbap, baby back ribs, and oxbone cream pasta. We also loved the Charlie's deli bagel dessert! I can't wait to go back and try more menu items!","5 Bleecker St New York, NY 10012"

The tables were super close together and don't believe there was AC on a hot summer day but we managed. They welcome you with a sake shot and the server was helpful to suggest 2-3 plates per person. We ordered the ceviche, ox one cream pasta, steak, and potato nugget. The potatoes were crispy, not overly salty, and well cooked. The cream pasta was decent but Asian inspired flavors didn't come out as well. The steak and ceviche were the star of our dinner.","5 Bleecker St New York, NY 10012"

2023-09-11,2023-09-16,C as in Charlie,"We loved this place! It's basically a Korean tapas place with a fusion/modern take on certain Korean dishes.Be sure to make a reservation! They were incredibly busy.We got the following dishes:- Potato nugget - pretty meh. It was just potato wedges with a truffle mayo. The potatoes were SO salty. Would not order again- Toast roll - so yummy! crunchy outside, delicious filling on the inside- Oxbone cream pasta - by far the best dish of the evening. As a Korean, this gave me instant seol-long-tang vibes with a creamy twist. I totally would've gotten another one if we hadn't ordered other things- Mushroom bibimbap - pretty good. The mushrooms were delicious. Not sure if I'd necessarily order again?- Seoulsbury steak - this was great too, definitely #2. It takes like tteok-galbi or japanese hamburg steak on a bed of creamy grits.The place was lively and the servers were nice. My only issues with the place was that the tables were placed so close together that I felt like our meal wasn't very private. It was also difficult to converse because of the proximity of tables and it being so loud.Having said that, I totally recommend this place and definitely recommend making a reservation!","5 Bleecker St New York, NY 10012"
2023-09-08,2023-09-16,C as in Charlie,"Notes: went here a while back. Using prices from an old menu. Best dishes by a mile are the first two listedAnyway, I went to this funky joint which is a mix of Korean and Soul food (I guess a good alt name would be Seoul food) a while ago with one of my usual groups. As it was a good while back, I don't remember all the details. The prices are pretty reasonable and it's designed as tapas style to share amongst a group. Lighting was dark with a lot of redness so I had to use the night light/flash and it was a bit loud. Food was overall fine but reasonably priced so it gets a bit more of a leeway. To drink, they gave us a sake shot at the beginning which was fun and I got a 99¢ Sweet Tea which was cheap and lightly sweetened.The best of the dishes were the Seoul'sbury Steak and the Mushroom Bibimbap. The former for $14 with gruyere grits and galbi jus was easily my favorite. I'm usually not the biggest fan of Salisbury steaks but the galbi jus elevated a usually bland dish into something new and delicious. Good texture as well and the grits were excellent. Good interpretation and if I was to go here alone, I'd order this. They could honestly make a burger out of this and I would go back for that as well.The latter bibimbap for $15 with hen of the woods and shimeji mushrooms and egg is one of the more popular dishes for a good reason. Good umami and a nice texture. Could be larger but hey it's $15 and I would order this as well and if I wanted a very filling meal, I'd order this and the steak.Heavier is the Toast Roll with shrimp, sweet chili, and citrus onion for $13. These resemble massive spring rolls and are filled with shrimp. A bit too heavy and a bit too oily but still tasty and it would make a great drinking food.There's not many lighter dishes on the menu outside of the the Fluke Ceviche with clementine, leche de tigre, and micro cilantro. I remember them not having the tuna tartare. This was $14 with a good light sweetness with some citrus flavors. I'd like a bit more spice to it but otherwise tasty.The Baby Back Ribs with harissa, plum coulis, and honey for $14 were alright.  The meat was cooked perfectly falling off the bone but I couldn't taste all the ingredients listed and I found it way too sweet. If the sauce was better, this would have likely been the third best dish.The Popcorn Chicken has a sweet gochujang glaze and it was $13. Lightly spiced yangnyeom, popcorn chicken style. Solid and tender though genericMy least favorite was the Oxbone Cream Pasta with spaghetti, bacon, and scallion for $13. The flavors were alright but I don't get why it's called oxbone when it was essentially Wafu Pasta; specifically Japanese style carbonara. Noodle texture was also not my favorite.For dessert, I decided not to get the famous bagel but instead I got the humorously named B As In Banana with misugaru, creme anglaise, and meringue for $9 or perhaps $11. The banana pudding itself isn't super sweet but the icing they give you to decorate it makes it a bit too sweet. I think it's the decoration also with the misugaru. Overall, it was fine though I likely would have preferred the bagel.Food overall was pretty good with two very good dishes, 2 pretty solid dishes, 2 OK dishes, and one not so good one, but the prices help. I'd go back for the steak and likely to try the bagel after. Low 4","5 Bleecker St New York, NY 10012"

We ordered:+ fluke ceviche: pretty tasty and eye pleasant+ mushroom bibimbap: loved the creativity and the flavor the mushroom brought to the plate. Delicious+ oxbone cream pasta: creamy and tasty+ seoul'sbury steak: it wasl alright, it wasnt the best nor the worst+ baby back ribs: the best dish of the night. It was tender, fresh, and flavorful. I sucked the bone till it was dry. Loved it!!!+ crab drop: worst dish of the night. It was a bit smelly and it didn't mix up well. I think it was out of proportion or tasteOverall, it had more plus than minus. Definitely loved it tapas experience but in Korean way. Will definitely come back to this place again in the future :)","5 Bleecker St New York, NY 10012"

It reminds me of those late night fun dinner places I went to in college back in Asia.We ordered a bunch of tapas: steak, pasta, bibimbap, fluke ceviche, short rib and crab drop soup. I liked all of them except for the crab drop soup, which was quite bit fishy for me. The steak is made of ground beef which was a bit unexpected but the grits come with it was really flavorful.Overall, it's a fun and cute Korean tapa place to check out.","5 Bleecker St New York, NY 10012"

Everything was so incredibly good, they all had exceptional flavour, cooked so well - all the flavours complimented  each other so well. The oxbone pasta probably was one of my favourites along with the toast roll, but everything was so fantastic it's hard to pick a favourite. Definitely, come here, this place is amazing!!

2023-09-13,2023-09-16,Hole In The Wall - Williamsburg,"There is an Anthony Bourdain quote that hangs in my 6 x 8 room that reads:""Eat at a local restaurant tonight...Listen to someone you think may have nothing in common with you. Order the steak rare. Eat an oyster. Have a negroni. Have two. Be open to a world where you may not understand or agree with the person next to you, but have a drink with them anyways...""Damn this is back to back reviews of me mentioning Bourdain, I need to chill ahahahaha. Nonetheless, I sat in my room yesterday with the quote looking down on me and I realized I haven't been living it accordingly. I mean it had been like 3 weeks since my last negroni lol...I have been to damn near every place in Alphabet City (A-TOWN STAND UP!), so decided to put my hard hat on and make the expedition to Williamsburg. I took a walk down Bedford Ave and let the spirits guide me. Can't stop the spirits when they need you.The spirits guided me to this place, as the interior made me feel like I am in a rich Manhattan Beach Mom's home. Beautiful and cozy with a slight hint of a beachy feel, yet not ostentacious.I sat at the bar, and was one of the only people in the place. I mean it was like 6pm ahahaaha. In the spirit of the Bourdain quote, I was fully ready to house a negroni. However, Morgan, one of the bartenders, began selling me about how fantastic their espresso martini is. ""It's the best in the city."" Then the other bartender, Danny, began saying the exact same thing with supreme confidence. It's like they were stating a fact rather than an opinion.I don't know if I have ever spoken that confidently about anything in my life ahahaha. Well I do make a pretty mean omelette if I'm being honest, but that's a conversation for another day.........I obviously had to order the espresso martini now. To my unanticipated delight, it came in a FROSTED glass, and I am a slut for a frosted glass. That attention to detail needs to be respected. The espresso martini itself was mf GAS, as there was cocoa powder sprinkled on top as well. They're not playing in here!!Me and Morgan got to talking about our shared love for Mezcal, and she ended up making me what I am dubbing the ""Morgan Special."" Idk what all was in it other than Mezcal and Tangerine Juice, but they need to get that on the menu ASAP.GOD DID!IG @jnov_Tiktok @jnov__","292 Bedford Ave Brooklyn, NY 11249"

I've done outdoor seating with my dog several times and they're always offer to get him water and the like.

YUMMY!!!Mylo who was our server was gorgeous and super sweet. And brought my niece a expresso martini made with Casa Amigos which was so much better than the vodka expresso martini! So cheers to Mylo. Ambiance was pleasant and chill. Not too loud. Just the right touch of everything you could ask for in a trendy spot! I am definitely coming back.

It's a small place, very cozy.They're known for having a killer natural wine selection so I knew I had to order a glass. Funky orange wine. Good stuff.They have a pretty short menu comprised of mostly small plates and larger mains all for sharing.1. Black bass: The fish was a good starter. Zingy and fresh.2. Romaine heart salad: the salad was also pretty good especially with the toasted nuts.3. Pig's head toast was a bit too porky for my taste but that's expected.4. The clams with the saffron broth and the pumpkin was killer. Definitely order some bread on the side with this.5. Spaghetti ala Norma: The pasta came buried underneath all the cheese. The texture was perfectly Al dente. You could feel the craggles and ridges and they perfectly captured the sauce. Good and homey. Nothing super omg different about the flavors but that pasta was superbly made.6. Peach ice cream was probably the let down of this meal. Came buried under all the whipped cream. The ice cream was good (don't get me wrong) but tasted nothing like peaches. Could not really tell what the flavor was if I'm being honest haha probably more tea-ish.Overall, The Four Horsemen is great. My type of restaurant. Would love to come back for dinner since they have a more extensive menu for that. Killer wine list. Small plates. Interesting combos. Nice place to chill with some friends and guzzle down some natty wine.","295 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

If you show up as soon as they open (or 15 mins before to be safe), they have bar / counter seating that is reserved for walk-ins.The service is very friendly and welcoming here. I came by myself and ordered three things off the menu, which was honestly more than enough food for me. The bread is a must-order, honestly might be the highlight of the whole meal with the butter!! The yellowfin tuna and swordfish are also incredible as well! The bartenders are knowledgeable on wines as well and can help you find the right pairing for your tastes.

We paid $25 for ONE (1) scallop on the shell that tasted like any scallop carpaccio you could get at a semi decent restaurant in the city. The tiger shrimp was edible, but for the prices they charge I expect there to be more than four shrimp and to not have to peel the head off the shrimp myself. Service and ambiance not particularly special. So many better options than this place.","295 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

From the Manager whose constantly drunk flirting with women in line bribing him to buy drinks if he lets them in (and accepts the bribe), To security personnel attitude being dismissive and condescending,(with preference obviously given to those who fit a certain demographic) Creating an unwelcoming atmosphere that only got worse as the night progressed.All I ask from James Murphy and his wife / Co-owner Christina Topsøe please take this feedback in consideration of your practices and the people you choose to be in position in power. your located in a predominantly LatinX community and your contribution as a business excludes this people based on your standards of class and service.Theres need more inclusivity and better management. It's not only about a single bad experience; it's about the broader implications of supporting an establishment that perpetuates racism and discrimination. I strongly urge anyone considering a visit to this bar to think twice and support businesses that prioritize diversity, respect, and inclusion over such abhorrent practices.Until significant changes are made to rectify these issues, I cannot in good conscience recommend this establishment to anyone.","295 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-08-08,2023-09-16,The Four Horsemen,"I may be hitting a wall with decent yet unexceptional restaurants in NYC using this ""shared plates"" concept to jack up prices with no corresponding uptick in service or quality. Right now, the average dinner in NYC costs around 80 bucks. This feels absolutely crazy to me. There was a time not long ago where one could dine well for half that price. Can we bring back the old fashioned entree and appetizer concept?Rant over.The Four Horsemen is a perfectly nice restaurant and the food was good if unremarkable. The space is so tiny that when the waiter placed a bottle of sparkling water on our table it got knocked over because another waiter had to squeeze by to get to the kitchen. The intimacy of the restaurant is actually quite sweet, but it's also slightly claustrophobic.We shared the tuna, the bread and butter, the marbled potatoes, the wax bean salad, a pasta with broccoli rabe and ndjua, and the roast chicken. The marbled potatoes was a rec from the server we would have otherwise overlooked and that was the star of the meal: roasted potatoes slathered in an umami rich charred scallion butter, dotted with ikura and topped with shaved bonito. It was complex, unusual and really delicious.Chicken was a roasted leg (foot included, for those who enjoy that sort of thing, I did not) with not a ton of meat on the bone, but wonderfully roasted, sitting in a pool of jus with roasted chanterelles and half a head of roasted garlic. It was good, but nearly impossible to eat.Everything else we ordered, contrary to what I've read about and heard, was simply decent. It was not a terribly inspired meal, but it did the trick. For dessert we had a nice cherry clafoutis. We each had a beer. The bill came to $250 with tip. The service was congenial, but once we placed our order our waiter kind of disappeared. 3.5 out of 5.","295 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

The oeuf mayonaisse is a work of art, and the marble potatoes are absolutely incredible, with charred scallion, smoked trout roe, and bonito flakes. We finished strong with a juicy golden chicken covered in morel mushrooms and roasted garlic.The prices are surprisingly good here for a Michelin-starred spot.

The fried rice is just excellent, with the runny egg providing moisture perfectly. The portion sizes are generous too, and it's all well-priced. The Bo Luc Lac is a winner, as well. Just amazing, and being a huge watercress person, I was bound to love the garnish on this one.The ambience is casual, yet trendy. The decor is pretty cool, and the service is excellent.

I appreciated that so much and they were so sweet despite my embarrassment.To start, we split the fried okra, on recommendation from our waitress.

The fried okra was bomb and we loved the sauce that came with it.Of course, we had the BBH Beef Shank - Braised then grilled whole beef shank, bone marrow gravy, and Bun Bo Hue sauce. It's market price and I think we paid $125 that day. The meat was SO tender and moist. You didn't even need the knife that they gave you, everything fell apart with just the fork. It was so flavorful and it's truly a huge portion. It comfortably fed the four of us and we had leftovers too.We also had the Com Chien Cua - Tamarind fried rice, lump crab, runny yolk, and rau ram. This was SO GOOD. I think I actually liked this more than the giant meat bone. It had just the right amount of acidity. I would gladly eat this over and over.We were too full for dessert, so I can't comment on that. But everything was so, so good. Service was fantastic and I cannot recommend them more.","104 2nd Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-04,2023-09-16,Monsieur Vo,"Went here with a large group & really enjoyed the meal and experience. The food was amazing. We got the Banh Mi Board, which I thought was delicious. The grilled shrimp was juicy & succulent. My girlfriend and I split the Tamarind BBQ Ribs & The Com Chien Cua.  Com Chien Cha is basically Crab Fried Rice & both entrees were really good too. But, my favorite part of the meal was dessert. The highlight of my night. The star of the show was the Vanilla Flan with Black Sugar Boba & Toasted Rice Ice Cream. I thought about it for weeks after I ate it. It was perfect. I'm already planning a trip to go back for the Beef Shank, Bone Marrow, Okra & Shrimp with Caviar.","104 2nd Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-01,2023-09-16,Monsieur Vo,"Overall rating: 4.8I've been wanting to go here for awhile & wow, it was worth it! After being served a few TikToks, I knew I wanted to try this place. I made a reservation, but don't think it was necessary based on the amount of people that was there during opening time.I went on a date and got 3 dishes without alcohol, our bill was ~$37 each.. which feels pretty high ish. But the food was very good! Very flavorful! The salad was so refreshing. And the noodles were addicting! I needed more. Bone marrow was good, but hard to split. I wanted it to myself!I'd come back on a paycheck day or if I have friends in town & want to show off. It's a very cute spot & definitely recommend!","104 2nd Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-07-26,2023-09-16,Monsieur Vo,"I stumbled upon this restaurant by accident & unknowingly. I have tried their sister restaurant Madame Vo, so imagine my surprise when I walked by Monsieur Vo.The interior decor was more traditional, very spacious, and the food was enjoyable. Waiters were friendly and attentive.I ordered the Banh Khot appetizer and shared the Monsieur Platter. The Vietnamese Ice Coffee was very strong. Highly recommend it. Lyche Iced Tea was a little on the sweeter side but not bad.The Banh Khot was very interesting. The dish was composed nicely. The caviar provided a boost of flavor. It looks like a savory (not sweet) cupcake.The monsieur platter made the meal enjoyable. It was basically a ""DIY summer roll"" with a stack of rice paper that we had to dip in warm water and then pack it with protein and vermicelli. All the meats were tender and marinated well. It came with two types of delicious sauce.It was a fun experience and I would come back to Monsieur Vo again.","104 2nd Ave New York, NY 10003"
2023-07-24,2023-09-16,Monsieur Vo,"TL;DR: Vietnamese gastropub with authentic flavors and top notch presentation. Service was attentive, gracious, and competent. Hipster location and on-trend ambiance.We came as four friends to catch up, eat good food, and treat ourselves. Monsieur Vo lives up to the social media hype. The good stuff is not cheap: Market price as of this post was $125 for the beef shank and $95 for the sea bass. The beef shank is enormous with flavor to match. Enough leftovers to feed two families a day later and you can use the bone to make broth at home. The sea bass - who was the surprise MVP - was served whole with head, fins, and tail, perfectly deep fried standing up, served with the sides of dry rice paper and warm water (a fascinating contraption), vermicelli noodles, and fixings to build your own summer roll (but we also ate it straight). 10/10 for taste, presentation, and just darn fun to eat. The staff were kind enough to give us more rice paper wrappers and fixings when they noticed we finished the first round - for a small price.Monsieur Vo is an excellent place to go with a group meal. Be warned - make reservations or wait 45 minutes on a Sunday night like we did!","104 2nd Ave New York, NY 10003"

2023-07-31,2023-09-16,Ampersand,"This place was full of life, the smell of eucalyptus, and the sound of playful throwback pop sounds on a Friday night. We had a very friendly and prompt server. We ordered drinks and an app. The chips for the chips and guac tasted a bit stale and not very salty unfortunately but the drinks were pretty good. I got the flamingo and really enjoyed it!","294 3rd Ave New York, NY 10010"

Jones (strong but a good slightly sweet!)the hot one (a classic spicy margarita that was definitely on the spicier side!)the hornet's best (the waitress said this was her favorite and that it was more spicy, but the mango definitely cut some of it so I think the hot one was actually way spicier but this was really good with the mango juice!)I'd definitely come back!","294 3rd Ave New York, NY 10010"
2023-07-02,2023-09-16,Ampersand,"Went to Ampersand on a Saturday evening around 9:30/10 with one other person. Based on other reviews I had expected (and was dreading) a wait but was surprised to see that there were a number of tables open. Thought I am not a huge fan of cocktails, this spot seemed to specialize in them so I had to try at least one. I opted for the poblano sour which was mezcal based. It was pretty good! I sort of wished it had a salt rim because I'm a sucker for a rim but the actual cocktail itself was slightly savory?? so it was fine without. It went down very easy and I enjoyed sipping on it. Opted for a tequila soda after and it didn't taste very strong so I'd say for those who want heavy pours on a night out this isn't the best.Shoutout to the waiter though, he was very warm and welcoming, I enjoyed being served by him!!","294 3rd Ave New York, NY 10010"

2023-06-03,2023-09-16,Ampersand,This is a really cute place to gather with your friends after work and get drinks. Their mojitos and margaritas (especially the passion fruit) are really great and nothing tastes like cheap alcohol. The ambience is very beautiful and romantic. I wish they cleaned up the bathroom a bit more regularly though. The food however was my least favorite part of this place. The guac and chips were less than okay and the shrimp tacos were not that satisfying or flavorful. I would advise to just get drinks here and get food elsewhere.,"294 3rd Ave New York, NY 10010"
2023-04-08,2023-09-16,Ampersand,Great cocktail bar in Gramercy! Cozy atmosphere with great cocktail selection. Friendly helpful bartender and server.

It does get a bit loud so you have to raise your voice to have a conversation but it's not too bad.They have a great cocktail menu with lots of gin and tequila options. The Hornet's Nest was sweet and fruity. The Hot One was only subtly spicy, but had a nice tangy taste and a flavorful salted rim.For food, their portion sizes were a bit on the smaller side. The buffalo cauliflower was tasty. The breading was fried into a hard shell so it was quite crispy. Their guacamole was chunky and fresh.Our waitress was not the most attentive but overall, service was pretty quick.","294 3rd Ave New York, NY 10010"
2023-08-20,2023-09-16,Dawn's ‘Til Dusk,"Popped into this cafe for a little afternoon work sesh. Super cute open interior and tons of windows with natural light. Staff is super friendly and they've got lots of tables which make it a great spot to work remotely from. Coffee was solid, dark and strong which is how I prefer it. I was a bit pekish and in need of something savory and was recommended the sea salt focaccia. To be honest, it wasn't amazing. I think this was mostly because it wasn't warmed up or toasted (maybe one could request for it to be). There was also more oil on the bottom than I would have liked when I picked it up. I was starving though so wolfed it down regardless!","33 Main St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

They'll also help with any recommendations needed.Food: got an ice latte with vanilla syrup ($6.25). Honestly, the vanilla syrup was such a good decision. Some syrups taste too syrup-y, but this one was a good balance and still let the coffee shine through.Can't wait to come back and get another pick me up drink here","33 Main St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-04-08,2023-09-16,Dawn's ‘Til Dusk,I stopped in to see if they had any vegan / gluten free cupcakes but I think they were out. The staff was friendly and the ambiance was so calm and cute! All they had left were the JUDITH cookies which were both vegan and gluten free. They are coconut toffee cookies and they were so so good! I wasn't expecting a vegan gluten free cookie to taste that good so it exceeded my expectations!,"33 Main St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-03-25,2023-09-16,Dawn's ‘Til Dusk,Cheese danish was super dry and almost stale tasting. Flavor was there but it was really the texture for me. I've also recently discovered that they claim to be a minority owned business but the owners are far from minorities to say the least (I've met them). Overall I just feel really bad for the staff as I've seen them getting ridiculed for minor things like speaking during a shift and hope they do better as a company!,"33 Main St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

It's close to Brooklyn Bridge Park. Just grab your favorite beverage and a pastry, then stroll the waterfront for some of the best views in the city!2.

She said it was best gluten free she's had.  I was so take by the place that I returned twice in a day. Lol.

The staff working were helpful in suggesting menu items and mentioned they're well-known for their housemade syrup... With that knowledge, we ordered a cappuccino with vanilla syrup and it was delicious - I'll be thinking about it for a while! It's definitely one of my top 3 cappuccinos I've ever had.Because we were hungry, we also split an order of quiche lorraine, which was tasty as well. The slice was very thick and filling, with a generous amount of ham and a perfectly flaky crust.We enjoyed their coffee so much we ended up getting a cold brew to go! This cold brew was different from others in that it was a bit lighter than other ones we've had, which we both appreciated.","33 Main St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

I will say that the salad dressing was flavorful.Most of the other reviews so far are about coffee and baked goods, so it might be worth a stop to grab those, but the food menu is way overpriced and underwhelming.","33 Main St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Rice Thief,"I have been craving Ganjang Gejang for a long while now and was excited to finally try it out at this place!Eating crab is too much work for me... that's why I was so happy and excited to try their salmon and shrimp!Both dishes were very flavorful, deeply seasoned and fresh! The combination of soy sauce, onion, jalapeño pepper works great together.The texture of shrimp is kinda slimy (in a good way though, for the lack of better words) and still retains a great crunch.The texture of salmon is similar to smoked salmon but a lot more tender and juicy!",
2023-07-27,2023-09-16,Rice Thief,"I got the white shrimp, scallops, soy marinated crabs, salmon, and the spicy marinated crabs! The highlight of the meal was definitely the white shrimp. The texture of the shrimp was so plump and juicy, and it was sweet. The scallops were fresh and my next favorite.The soy marinated crabs were not bad, but I wish that there was more tang or a little more sweetness to cut the salt. There were onions in the sauce, however, I barely tasted them. Be aware that the smallest order is 6 pieces which only amounts to 3 crabs for $28.50. I recommend getting at least 12 pieces for two people.The salmon was also a bit too salty and very standard. I would not say it was the freshest.My least favorite were the spicy marinated crabs. I am alright with some heat, but these were almost painfully spicy. I couldn't taste the marinade over the spice and had to mix the sauce of the other crabs and add some lemon juice to eat it.Overall, the seafood here is super fresh, and I highly recommend the shrimp!",
2023-07-24,2023-09-16,Rice Thief,"It took a few weeks for us to successfully place an order as they are quite popular. Unfortunately, I don't think the wait was worth it. The crabs tasted mediocre at its best, can be cleaned better and can probably be better marinated if they were chopped in half like other restaurants do. The scallops didn't taste fresh, the soy crabs were better than the spicy ones in our opinion. Since there aren't many places that make Korean raw crabs, I think it's worth trying but not something I'd go out of my way to wait weeks to order.",
2023-07-08,2023-09-16,Rice Thief,Got delivery. Saw the hype through instagram and wanted to try. Definitely worth it the spicy marinated crab was delicious and so spicy which I love. The sauce is awesome!,
2023-07-05,2023-09-16,Rice Thief,"I know there is a lot of hype to this place, so I was super excited to try this place out. However, it disappointed me in multiple ways. I got the soy marinated salmon, soy marinated crab, and the spicy crab.First, the crabs were both a little too crabby and has the bit of seafood stench that I don't like. It was more obvious in the soy crab. The spicy crab tasted better in my opinion, but the crab had too much of a raw seafood taste. However, I have to say the portions are pretty big for 3 crabs.Second, the salmon - it was way too salty. Salmon itself is already really good on its own. It isn't necessary to marinate the salmon - it could have been a great sauce to instead complement it rather than be marinated with. It takes away the salmon flavor as well.Ordering online was pretty simple, can be ordered either through UberEats (which is more expensive) or through Instagram (they are very responsive).Overall, not my thing, but it can be especially for those who enjoy their raw crab, and like to work for their food with gloves that they provide you (which is nice).",
2023-07-04,2023-09-16,Rice Thief,The food was very fresh and well-seasoned. I ordered to go. Next time I will eat here,
2023-06-20,2023-09-16,Rice Thief,"I have never written a review for food before but I've seen this place blow up on TikTok and Instagram and always wanted to order from here. I ordered the soy crab, korean spicy crab, red shrimp, and jokbal. It was so delicious and tasted way better then it looked. I am so glad I got to try it and will definitely tell my friends and family about this place. Look forward to ordering from here again, highly recommend!",
2023-06-20,2023-09-16,Rice Thief,I wanted the marinated crabs to be a bit saltier but overall the food was tasty and a good experience. It is on the expensive side but I definitely recommend it. I highly recommend the red shrimp because the meat is firmer and sweeter than the white shrimp variation. Keep in mind that this place only does take out!!!,
2023-06-19,2023-09-16,Rice Thief,"This was my first time trying marinated crab, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but the food was amazing! We ate it quickly so the raw food wouldn't get warm, and each bite was so flavorful and meaty. The veggies and jalapeño were such a nice touch, and service was fast and casual. Definitely coming back!",
2023-06-12,2023-09-16,Rice Thief,"We thought rice thief was just okay. We got both the soy and the spicy one, and we preferred the spicy one more. The sauce is pretty good and it goes well with rice, and the spice definitely builds in your mouth because of the jalapenos in the sauce.  The soy sauce crab, however, was not marinated enough- the seasoning does not go all the way through the crab. We found that the crab was a little fishy as well, which made us a little worried that it wasn't fresh enough- but we didn't get food poisoning!We also had the shrimp- it has the same sauce as the soy crab and its got a nice fresh crunch/biteWe've had better crab but at least the prices were comparable to other crab I've had. I have hopes that rice thief will get better with time though! The spicy crab sauce was my rice thief this meal!",

2022-11-17,2023-09-16,Fifty Henry,"Wandering around in Brooklyn Heights on a beautiful night, we just came from Vineapple cafe and had a huge dinner, so then next our idea was to have to order desserts and drinks.  The cocktail and wine menu here is quite extensive.  The service is minimal, no fuss, but gets the job done.  The lady who waited our table came back to check on us after we received our orders which was a nice touch.I had my heart set on the creme brulee, yet the restaurant ran out which happens.  Instead of creme brulee, I ordered the Atlantic peach pie and had an accompanying glass of white wine which was fantastic.  I saw the menu was not packed with tons of options which I saw makes it great for someone who struggles with decision analysis paralysis.  I saw many delicious options so I would totally go back in a heartbeat.Note: When my group arrived, we waited 5 to 10 minutes to get a table.  It's really popular, and I love the quiet dim lit ambience inside.Upside: there was a live jazz trio playing, and all of us loved the music.   It does close early like 10 PM, so just something to think about if you are looking for a late, late night drinking spot.  The staff was kind about not rushing us out, but I just thought to mention that last point.","50 Henry St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

The employees were so welcoming and fun, especially the bartender, Angel. For drinks we got the Tea It Up, which was the perfect NYC drink. The place was also nicely decorated. We will definitely be back!","22 1/2 Ninth Ave New York, NY 10014"
2023-04-28,2023-09-16,Helen's,"Helen's exceeded our expectations, walking in as soon as they opened ended up being the best vibe we experienced in New York. We found ourselves coming back and having a blast. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!","22 1/2 Ninth Ave New York, NY 10014"
2023-04-21,2023-09-16,Helen's,"I'm at that life stage where my kids are old enough to enjoy cocktails with their parents. Yay! My daughter found this on Yelp, as we were in the area. Once you descend the stairs, it feels like you've entered a Thai temple. And as luck would have it, we went on a Weds. when apparently it's BOGO. Our drinks were good and our server kept the water filled. It was oddly not crowded, either. Maybe weekends are busier. All in all- a nice nightcap to a great family day.","22 1/2 Ninth Ave New York, NY 10014"
2023-04-13,2023-09-16,Helen's,Came here for their BOGO drinks on Wednesdays. The server was very quick and attentive. It was not to busy but I think was because NYC was having great weather and they do not have outdoor seating. We had the lychee martinis which are so GOOD!!!! It a very cute warm spot because of the lighting. It's very spacious. They only thing disappointing was how limited their menu was so we only had one drink because we were hungry. I would definitely return on a full stomach to have their lychee martinis,"22 1/2 Ninth Ave New York, NY 10014"

2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Roscioli,"Bravo! Bravo! I am blown away by the exceptional southern Italian fare served in this fantastic space.They are not fully open yet, but will be soon.We attended a wine pairing dinner in the basement. The space actually feels like something in Rome. Exposed old brick. Just dark enough.Our multi course meal was highlighted by small producer Italian wine varietals. In an interesting twist we were also served some French wines for comparison. Just brilliant. And the somm did a great job explaining and instructing.The course sizes were just right.Most designed to eat left to right with various takes on the dish. A highlight for me was the tuna. Cooked, raw, belly. This is also the first time I ever had tomato water to pair with food. Sounds odd. Tastes incredible. Apparently it is one of the chef's specialties.I must say a highlight for me was the cheese course. I've never had such rich, nutty, aged, smooth cheeses. I will not soon forget.Welcome, Roscioli.  You are sure to be a hot ticket.","43 MacDougal St New York, NY 10011"
2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Roscioli,"We did the wine class/tasting and it was incredible. The food was amazing, the wine pairings were amazing, the sommelier was amazing and the service was great. I can't wait for the full restaurant to be open.","43 MacDougal St New York, NY 10011"
2023-08-19,2023-09-16,Roscioli,"Love the concept, like the space and the service is excellent. The tasting is a reboot of Niche Niche. I'm a big fan of Ariel Arce who is an amazingly creative entrepreneur and has two hits in Airs Champagne Parlor and Tokyo Record Bar. Unfortunately it hasn't yet come together for this space. When you are doing a set menu food and wine pairing both have to be excellent, particularly with Italian food and wine which are both wonderful and readily available in NY, particularly the West Village. While everything is good, nothing is particularly memorable. The wines were fine, but poor examples of the amazing wines that you can get today from Italy. For an August Italian dinner you would expect more vegetables and if you are going to serve tiramisu, a dessert on the most basic Italian restaurant in middle America, it better be a phenomenal tiramisu and there's is not. Roscioli is a work in progress and I'm hopeful that they will up their game. We will be back to check on their progress in a few months.","43 MacDougal St New York, NY 10011"
2023-08-11,2023-09-16,Roscioli,"this is not an attack on the sweet italian man who is one of the owners. him and the food (besides feeling heavy since the tiramisu was the freshest bite) was enjoyable.the energy is off here. we sat at the communal table that is a weird shape. it's giving omakase  not warm italian hugs.the host immediately tried to upsell us on the added dish of the night, in a weird way. we sat down, went over the menu and he came over and said so we all like tuna???? yes??? okay, 1,2,3 tunas for the table. my friend and  i caught into this and cancelled it but weird....the wine pours are slim. totally to about 8 oz total for the night.dishes were heavy. delish but zero vegetables. my panzanella was all bread. i saw 4 tomatoes on my plate of burrata that i shared with my friend.all dishes were small too. i expected a few more surprise bites to be honest.service was interesting... it felt like a broadway show.i would definitely go back in rome, but not here. i would try when they open a la carte but this downstairs tasting menu in my opinion, is not it.","43 MacDougal St New York, NY 10011"
2023-07-29,2023-09-16,Roscioli,Excellent service & tasting menu. Came here on opening week and will certainly be returning,"43 MacDougal St New York, NY 10011"
2023-07-28,2023-09-16,Roscioli,"Everything was exceptional from the meal to the service to the atmosphere. Dinner felt like a performance as the staff knew the food and wine inside and out, yet was was also perfectly balanced, casual and lighthearted. A wonderful dinner - can't wait to come back.","43 MacDougal St New York, NY 10011"
2023-07-21,2023-09-16,Roscioli,Did the tasting menu last night and fabulous. High quality food and wine and the decor has cool vibes. Plus lovely staff. Great combination!,"43 MacDougal St New York, NY 10011"
2023-07-19,2023-09-16,Roscioli,"Did the tasting menu on a Monday at 6pm. They have 2 seatings - 6pm and 8:30pm. Entrance is in the basement level!Started with refreshing orange drink and then we got BREAD & OLIVE OIL to start. The bread was run-of-the-mill but the olive oil was the light, refreshing, and I want to say ""fruity"". I really enjoyed the olive oil and they refilled our olive oil too because we went through it too fast! Be careful of the bread though, you don't want to fill yourself up before all the food.The actual first course was PANZANELLA (a bread salad) and a BURRATA dish. A lot of bread going on thus far in the meal! The panzanella was solid but not life-changing. I enjoyed how the bread came in the panzanella, a bit damp and soft. The tomatoes and rest of the salad were yummy and perfectly flavored. I'm not a burrata fan in general so will not say anything about it.The second course was the MEZZE MANICHE ALLA CARBONARA which was my favorite dish of the night. The mezze maniche pasta tubes were so Q (perfect texture imo) and the sauce was just right. The dish only came with 12 pasta tubes. Sad! It was paired with a red wine.The third course was the POLPETTE CON MUSHROOM BRODO which I slurped up. The dish was lightly salted. It's a single meatball, so yet again it's another small dish. This was also paired with a red wine, but the dish was gone in such few bites that I had a lot of wine left.We got an extra course of CHEESE & BALSAMIC VINEGAR. The cheese was crunchy on the outside. It was very cheesy, I'm personally not a cheese fan but tried out a small piece anyway. The balsamic vinegar was very thick.The last dish was a TIRAMISU that also came with a little dessert quiche looking thing that was sweet and delicious. This was paired with a dessert MOSCATO that was so so so good, best drink of the night (I like sweet things).Overall, I enjoyed the food and the ambiance. It took a bit over 2 hours for all the food to be delivered to us. The entire restaurant eats each round at the same time. I had no issues with the service.","43 MacDougal St New York, NY 10011"
2023-07-16,2023-09-16,Roscioli,"They just opened. Really cool handsome space, solid prosciutto and melon and wines. Wishing them the best of luck!","43 MacDougal St New York, NY 10011"
2023-09-05,2023-09-16,Lindens,"I was straying at the Arlo and ended up having both breakfast and lunch here. Lunch was excellent. I had a glass of Sangiovese and the gnocchi. The gnocchi was beautiful and came with giant pillows that melted in your mouth. I savored every bite! I topped the meal off with the peach crème brûlée which was also delicious.Breakfast the following day left a lot to be desired. I ordered a latte, pancakes and a side of bacon. The pancakes were very dense and thicker than the width of a knife. It did not taste very good and I wasn't able to finish it.I don't think the pancakes were a good representation of the quality at Lindens. I enjoyed my experience and lunch was quite memorable. The interior was clean and the service was excellent. I wish I could remember my waiter's name because he was amazing.","2 Renwick St New York, NY 10013"
2023-08-30,2023-09-16,Lindens,"Good food but non existent service. Took forever to be seated there was no staff in sight. No check in during meals and everything took long for no reason, it wasn't packed maybe like 2 other tables. Food came out at a reasonable time but it was the waiter not being visibility there to take our order and not being there for a while/flagging him down for the bill. The meal took longer than expected.","2 Renwick St New York, NY 10013"
2023-08-25,2023-09-16,Lindens,"We had brunch on a Saturday and we chose to sit outside because the weather was so nice. The service was so good.Our waitress was so friendly and patient (we were with a small child and asked for an umbrella to cover us from the sun). We ordered a few things: salad, pasta, pizza, toast, and açai bowl. All of them were so fresh and delicious.Somehow they just knew how to make good meal with a perfect balance of taste, texture, and temperature. All meals were worth the price. Seemed a bit high at first, but they were just so good. Would definitely recommend this restaurant!","2 Renwick St New York, NY 10013"

2023-07-24,2023-09-16,Lindens,"The vibe and food here is definitely a 10/10. We've come back to celebrate birthdays and also one of our go-to places when friends come into town. The place itself is not in a super fun party of the city, but once you enter you can't even tell. I've heard the hotel rooftop is also nice, so definitely something to check out next time.For the food!Appetizers:Parker Rolls (5/5): A definite must! Sometimes when we go, we even need to get 2 orders it's that's good.Tempura (5/5): It was definitely good, but when it's just the 2 of us we skip this.Crispy Fennel Pita (4/5): Would skip this next time. Nothing bad about it, just not the best that they have.Pasta Pomodoro (4/5): Super light and fresh, but not the star of the showButternut Squash Ravioli (5/5): The ravioli is absolutely amazing and the sauce just melts in your mouth. I can't go to Lindens (even for brunch) and not get thisCookies (--): I don't eat chocolate, but my boyfriend LOVES themFor brunch we shared a round of pancakes. They were good, but definitely on the thicker / dryer side. With enough maple syrup it was amazing, but the ravioli is definitely the winner in my eyes.","2 Renwick St New York, NY 10013"

From the warm welcome and recommendations by Levi and the fantastic service by Andreas, this place was outstanding.

I also appreciated the fact that we weren't hurried out after paying our bill.My drink (I forgot the name, but it was vodka based), was delicious.","212 Front St New York, NY 10038"

The portions were generous and the quality was solid.The Baby Kale Salad came with ample veggies and not too much dressing. The Paccheri All' Agnello was flavorful and al dente, while the Linguine Alle Vongole E Bottarga was generously full of clams.Throw in the dark, candlelit ambience, and you've got the ideal, affordable date spot by the sea.","212 Front St New York, NY 10038"
2023-08-25,2023-09-16,Osteria Del Porto,"A charming and rustic gem right on the corner of Peck and Beekman, Osteria was the perfect spot to celebrate a birthday.Though I might have dined here at the same location, my memory is inclined to say it was not Osteria but another restaurant in the pastWe had wonderful sidewalk seating equipped with lights and a cozy quietness since it wasn't a busy, mainstream block. And that suited us just fine.Service was very attentive as well as receiving  recommendations from the server.Crusty bread and aioli was brought to the table after drink orders were taken.We ordered a few appetizers for the table. I tried the Fried Calamari (delicious), Arancini (crispy and light) and a piece of the Mushroom flatbread (an abundance of shrooms to please the palate).I ordered a delicious Venetian Spritz which was really an Aperol. As usual, refreshing and delicious.For main, I chose The Atlantic Cod (Pistachio crusted Cod Filet with forbidden rice, lemon risotto) which was a winner. Light, flaky Cod Filet sat on a Risotto bed and the marriage of flavors were quite pleasing and well executed.My finish was the Panna Cotta. They had the traditional Italian desserts and all looked amazing but on this evening, I deviated from the Tiramisu and chose this. Always a crowd pleaser, the Panna Cotta was a refreshing ending to a great meal.I'm definitely returning to Osteria Del Porto when in the area. Everything about it was charming--ambience, service and especially the food. Above all, the company. Isn't that what it's really all about anyway?","212 Front St New York, NY 10038"
2023-08-19,2023-09-16,Osteria Del Porto,This is by far the best pasta I have eaten in my entire LIFE. Better than anything I ate in Italy. We had the Cacio E Pepe and the truffle gnocchi and my life is forever changed. It tasted as if the noodles were made that evening. Service was incredible. Patio dining ambience was perfect and felt very European. 10/10 would recommend and would die to eat here again.,"212 Front St New York, NY 10038"

2023-04-07,2023-09-16,Frangos Peri Peri,"The service was excellent. Both the owner and our server were extremely attentive, explained everything and from the time of order until we got our food, it was a breeze. We ordered a family style meal with spicy rice that complimentwd the chicken very well. The fries were absolutely delicious and we ordered a second serving. The chicken (both regular and wings) were perfectly cooked and moist. It was extremely flavorful. We tried the extra hot, which was too hot for me, but others in our party with higher heat tolerance loved them. My favorite was the Hot. It was tangy and had the perfect amount of heat that gave it a kick, but wouldn't kick your ass. The mango and lime was interesting and probably our least favorite, but it was still good. The mango flavor was bolder, but it was worth a try. The garlic and herb was also a huge hit for the non-spicy eaters.","182 Avenue B New York, NY 10009"
2023-03-15,2023-09-16,Frangos Peri Peri,"The chicken with mild sauce was great! When I went here I was expecting Nando's type of food and sauce, since I grew up with it and it was similar to Nando's but much better. The chicken was soft and very flavourful. The sides were also great. We got the grilled cauliflower, seasoned fries, and naan bread. The only downside is that they need more employee for the shift, it was hard to get their attention when we're standing on the counter.","182 Avenue B New York, NY 10009"
2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Boutros,"I came here with a friend for weekday dinner. We were seated promptly at our reservation time.I love Mediterranean food so I was excited to try this place. We got the labneh dip, heirloom tomato and burrata, grilled octopus skewers, and duck breast.Price wise, it's a little on the pricey side but not too bad for NYC. The food was all pretty good, but the standout item was definitely the labneh dip with pita. It comes with truffle honey drizzled on top, hazel nuts and rosemary. The dip was our favorite thing and my friend even got one to go.Not 100% sure I'd come back, but if I do, I will 100% get the labneh dip again.","185 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"

First of all, the portion was HUGE - two thick slabs of bread. They were toasted well on the outside and perfectly moist on the inside. The pistachio butter was very flavorful and unique. The beef shawarma sandwich my partner ordered was also delicious. The server was friendly and attentive just like the last time. Highly recommend this place!","185 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"

I had the homemade ginger ale and we had the Miso Baba Ganoush and the mushroom hummus . I really thought both was sooooo beautifully flavored and the pita bread ,the pita bread was so warm it was so gooood omg lol. My favorite was the mushroom hummus . It had a slight sweetness to it . I enjoyed both so very much . We also had the Fluke Crud which was so interesting and the falafel was the smoothest ever and perfect crunchy exterior . Our server was super attentive and kind and I just really loved this place . And I would recommend getting like 4 to 5 things on the menu and sharing it . Delicious delicious delicious . I will for sure be back ! And the price range is very decent for the high quality food you're getting . Keep doing your thanggggg","185 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-07-03,2023-09-16,Boutros,"We had a five-star experience at Boutros last night! The four of us split a bunch of tasty treats. The short rib shawarma hummus was exceptional - it's a must order! The labneh was whipped deliciousness and they were kind enough to put the nuts on the side so those with nut-allergies could also enjoy. Both served with fresh, fluffy, and warm pita. The butternut squash kibbeh was very special; lots of great flavors and textures. The American wagyu kebab was also very special and I'd consider another must order dish! The pork chop was also good, but compared to the other things, it wasn't anything special. I definitely look forward to coming back to try other dishes (e.g., the burrata dish, the duck dish, etc, etc)! Plus, they serve mocktails, which I greatly appreciate. I very much enjoyed the pomegranate mojito. On top of the stellar meal, the service was extremely friendly and attentive, and the space is beautiful.","185 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"

2023-04-16,2023-09-16,Boutros,"It started off strong with the Short rib shawarma hummus and fresh pita. But we weren't fans of the entrees we ordered.For $30 the roasted half chicken was not worth it. The chicken was hard and dry in some parts, and we didn't think the sauce or fries paired all that well as a cohesive dish.The French toast was massive but I think the texture of the whole thing was just too soft, leaning soggy.However this is a really nice ambiance and I would 100% come back to try other things.","185 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"

2023-09-13,2023-09-16,Double Chicken Please,"My friend and I came here without a reservation at around 10 PM and waited around 30 minutes in line for the front room. While waiting in line, we also had the option of being on the waitlist for the back room in case someone cancels so we did just that -- turns out, we got lucky and got into the back room! There were other names on the waitlist as well, but it seems as if you'd have to physically wait in line to actually be considered for the back room.We ended up getting Japanese Cold Soba Noodles and Mango Sticky Rice. I LOVED the Cold Soba Noodles drink -- it tasted exactly like the dish! The mango sticky rice was just okay in my opinion, I didn't taste much of a resemblance to the dessert. Service was also exceptional and loved watching the bartenders make the drinks.We also got Le Big Mac and Popcorn Chicken. I thought both were also just okay.I would come back to try more cocktails, but as for their small foods/snacks, I'd skip.","115 Allen St New York, NY 10002"
2023-09-13,2023-09-16,Double Chicken Please,A hour wait that was worth the try! There is reservation available for big parties in the back. The place was loud and bustling when I got in.The tables are kinda small and mainly meant for drinks. I ordered the mochi donut chicken sandwich.   The texture was interesting but it went well with the pineapple and hot sauce underneath. My friend ordered the salted egg yolk one I also wanted to try. The yolky flavor was there but its not that prominent. It was still good though! The popcorn chicken tasted like popcorn chicken and not worth the price. The hojicha pudding was really good dessert! You have to give your card beforehand and close the tab after.,"115 Allen St New York, NY 10002"
2023-09-10,2023-09-16,Double Chicken Please,"Came here a second time at 4:30 on a Sunday. We waited in line and at the front they told us there would be a table in 2 hours for the back room. We went to eat dinner and got a text 1.5 hours later and we're seated around 10 min after that. I think this is the best way to do it since it's impossible to get a reservation. We tried a lot of the top menu and my conclusion is you can't go wrong with anything you choose. My personal favorites are the Cold Noodle salad - super light and savory with a hint of sweetness. Has the Asian flavors in a cold noodle salad but not weird at all. Love the beet salad, again it's earthy and not too sweet and pairs well with the creaminess. The perfect dessert drink that most people loved was the French toast! The bathroom also had a candle lit which I think is just a nice extra touch and makes the overall experience super pleasant.","115 Allen St New York, NY 10002"
2022-12-18,2023-09-16,Double Chicken Please,"Alright so we came on a Saturday night around 5 and there was a long line. We waited like an hour to get into the front room and put our names down for the back room. The front room is not worth it as all the cocktails are on tap. The food is very MEH like we tried the hot chicken sandwich, cucumbers, and Big Mac and found it all underwhelming. Just come here to put your name down for the back room or make a reservations because the drinks back there were awesome. We got a normal whisky sour which my boyfriend said was definitely above par than normal ones you make at home, I loved the beet salad (perfect creaminess and earthiness without because too much), the French toast was also creamy and almost coffee like without having any coffee and even though was sweet, did not taste too much to me, and we also got the aviation which was very refreshing!","115 Allen St New York, NY 10002"
2023-09-09,2023-09-16,Double Chicken Please,"I highly recommend you get a reservation for the back room. Walk up can range in time but it can be from 15 min to 2 hrs and probably longer. When I arrived I was open to sitting wherever which was about an hour wait, the back room would have been a 2hr wait. When we sat down, the waitress gave us water right away and said she'd be back for our order. It took some time to get our order in, but when we did, the food and drinks arrived shortly after. The hot honey chicken sandwich was so crispy and crunchy yet so juicy and soft on the inside. The bun wasn't my favorite upon first bite but it slowly grew on me. Oh but the sauce, wow it was delicious! Overall the chicken is a solid 10/10. The drinks were a little expensive for what they were but it was still worth the try.","115 Allen St New York, NY 10002"
2023-09-08,2023-09-16,Double Chicken Please,"Honestly, it's overhyped. It's expensive and the wait is long. The popcorn chicken tasted stale after it cooled down.

2023-09-04,2023-09-16,Double Chicken Please,"One of the more creative and interesting cocktail bars I've been to. Reservations ""The Coop"" back room are hard to come by but if you show up on a weekday you can often walk-in. All of drinks are named after various foods and it's pretty crazy how close they resemble the actual food. You can tell that the bar uses some pretty crazy techniques to create their various infusions and liqueurs. The fried chicken is also a tasty bonus but the cocktails are of course the star of the show.","115 Allen St New York, NY 10002"

We put our names down on a Tuesday evening and it was about a 2hr wait, but we had dinner reservations at that time and the hostess was able to accommodate around our schedule. The bartender who was a taller white gentleman was super friendly and gave us some other bar recommendations to go to afterwards which were all a hit.Definitely give it a try but be prepared to wait long hours","115 Allen St New York, NY 10002"

Everything was totally booked, so my friend and I decided to go on a weekday right when it opened. We were in line at 4:30pm and successfully made it into The Coop.Due to a time crunch, my friend and I ordered all 5 drinks at once.Japanese cold noodle (5/5): I thought this drink was incredibly clever and delicious! The name is basically what it tasted like. I enjoyed it.Key lime pie (5/5): Refreshing and carbonated alcoholic soda that's sweet. I enjoyed it.Mango sticky rice (2/5): Pretty disappointed in this one. I definitely did not taste any similarities with mango sticky rice. My friend said this is what DCP is known for though lol.Cold pizza (2/5): Tasted exactly like cold pizza, but not for me. It reminded me of guzpacho lol tbh.French toast (3/5): Reminds me of a white russian; creamy and heavy without the coffee.","115 Allen St New York, NY 10002"
2023-08-31,2023-09-16,Double Chicken Please,"I'm not an expert on cocktails or alcohol but these cocktails definitely do taste like the best bar in North America. They deserve that title (not to mention, it's the 6th best bar in the world!!)Drinks: The key lime pie was SO good. Perfect balance of flavors. French toast was good too but the key lime pie  cocktails... 10/10. Truly.Food: Ordered the hot honey and tofu sandwich. I love how they used Taiwanese inspired flavors for these. The hot honey was better than the tofu but both were pretty good. Doesn't compare to the cocktails though. Maybe like a... 7.5/10?Vibe: so the they have a front room and a back room (the coop). The front room vibe has a young energetic vibe to it whereas the back room is very sophisticated, intimate, and dark.IMPORTANT NOTE: let me just say... I've been trying to get a res for MONTHS. It's impossible on resy. Reservations come out 7 days in advance at midnight. When you refresh your screen at midnight, there are literally only TWO time slots left. And when you try to click on it, it'll say it's unavailable!! So yeah. Good luck getting a res for the back room.

It was a mild fall evening and we found street parking about a 10-minutes' walk away.It was 9 or 10 PM, but the market was still open for business. There are several vendors inside that operate as bars and there were at least a handful of customers trickling in at that hour.We dipped in for a quick bathroom break and then headed up the stairs to the rooftop to take in the nightscape. While the lower floors are dedicated to vendors, the upper floors are inhabited by office spaces. The stairs are open-concept and as we ascended, we peered into the dark windows of empty desks and conference rooms beside us.Once we surfaced, we were met with a view unlike any other. The serene nightscape opened up before us. Despite the pandemic, the night felt young, brimming with possibility. We drank in the sight with our eyes, but couldn't resist taking a few shots with our phones to take some memories for keeps. It was the ultimate way to end a night in the city.","55 Water St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

2023-09-04,2023-09-16,YunShang Rice Noodle House,"This is a great deal!! All in, the meal was around $15, which I think is really great. I loved the platter of toppings and being able to pick and choose what was going into my soup. The soup was super hearty, and the rice noodles were nicely chewy. My friend and I were both too full to go beyond the one bowl of rice noodles that was given in the beginning, but I think that just goes to show how filling this meal is. It's always great to have the option for more if you want it!The restaurant was small but didn't feel too cramped. The service was nice and everything came out quickly.","53 Bayard St New York, NY 10014"
2023-09-02,2023-09-16,YunShang Rice Noodle House,"I got the mushroom broth and added beef. The broth here is very clean and definitely a good bang for your buck. You put the noodles and toppings in and let the clay pot cook everything.I also got a chicken skewer which was crispy on the outside, very flavorful and was juicy on the inside.4/5 overall - solid spot, good price, though nothing jaw dropping.","53 Bayard St New York, NY 10014"
2023-08-26,2023-09-16,YunShang Rice Noodle House,"The food is good, but the service is lacking. When our server came to take our order, he basically half-heartedly grunted when I ordered the spicy noodles, and my friend ordered the pork with pickled cabbage. I found it kind of funny, but then a few seconds later, he came back to clarify what my friend ordered because he completely forgot... We only ordered 2 things!The table, menu, and utensils aren't the cleanest, but I mainly come here for a hearty noodle dish at a good price. There is a variety of side dishes that come along with it, and you are allowed refills on the noodles.","53 Bayard St New York, NY 10014"
2023-08-24,2023-09-16,YunShang Rice Noodle House,"My friends insisted that I should stop by to visit this place and I finally did. First, the food was cheap and the service was fast. It was everything I pictured. The noodles were delicious, but the cripsy salt chicken and soup needed extra seasoning/more flavor. I ordered the coconut curry but I found myself adding extra spices. The place was clean and spacious and it was not overcrowded. In terms of customer services, I was not pleased. We asked the waiter a few questions and he was sassy and rude with his response. Besides that, I highly recommend this place. If you want noddles and soup then you should visit!","53 Bayard St New York, NY 10014"
2023-08-14,2023-09-16,YunShang Rice Noodle House,"This place is excellent! You get what you order so there's no mystery. I like spicy so I ordered curry soup base and rice noodles.

The huge warm broth comes in many flavors and I got to sample the sour fish and tomato. It's what we call in Chinese ""appetizing"" in a way you just want to keep eating. The variety of toppings are fun and the noodles are good and bouncy.","53 Bayard St New York, NY 10014"

It was my first time but I was already excited to try the food based on all the rave reviews on Yelp!I was impressed with how affordable the noodles were, it gave off a hotpot vibe when I was looking at the options. Both my friend and I went with the tomato base soup for a more refreshing meal. There was a bunch of toppings (enough to fill a whole tray!) for you to put in the soup broth, along with some strips of pork belly. Although there was a lot of variety, after I put it in the soup, it disappeared and I feel like barely made a difference. They only served 4 pork belly strips so it would help to order another side dish to go with it. Tomato base soup was exactly as I imagined - a little tart and savory at the same time. We got the cold spicy chicken and that was pretty decent. Service was good and quick. I would definitely come back to try their other soup bases if I'm looking for a quick cheap meal.","53 Bayard St New York, NY 10014"

I was hunkering for noodles (as I always am), and my husband found this place.I wasn't sure what to expect because when you look at the menu it's a little confusing. I don't remember which one we got but I think we both got the original. It comes with separate toppings and a large clay-pot bowl with the noodles. You add the toppings first and then add the noodles. It looks like a lot when you see it but it's not that large of a portion when you actually start eating it. Everything is really good and I would go back and try something different next time around.It's not expensive, the service is fast, and the place is always bustling. We got there when it was still a little empty, but halfway through it filled up. So get there early if you want a seat.

Waiter was pleasant and informative. Unfortunately, the food ranged from OK to disappointing. Certainly very disappointing for a Jean Georges restaurant and for the price of the meal. Separate from the unimpressive quality of the food is the fact that one dish came out cold and one drink order was ""forgotten"". The cold dish was warmed up promptly and returned at an appropriate temperature. There may also be a staffing issues as the person who brought the food over to the table seemed baffled in trying to figure out which dish went to which person and took a very long time getting dishes in front of people (which probably contributed to the poor temperature quality of my dish). It was a nice place to have a celebratory meal but definitely do not intend to return. NYC has too many much better options at that price point.","89 South St New York, NY 10038"

Arrived a little after 5pm on a holiday weekend, the restaurant was not busy at all at this time and we were surprised at how cold and rude the hostess was- said our only option was to sit alone inside and no outdoor tables would be available for almost an hour even though the outdoor tables barely full. We sat inside and no server appeared for 15 mins- so we had the thought to go online- booked an outdoor table for the exact moment we were sitting there- no wait- and revisited the stand where there was now a kind male host who immediately gave us an outdoor table. Total nonsense and our disappointment lingered through the meal. Food is still great but the staff need serious oversight and retraining. I won't return anytime soon.","89 South St New York, NY 10038"

2023-08-24,2023-09-16,The Fulton by Jean-Georges,"Host stand really came through on our request for a very nice table as our family dinner was marking a big occasion. Beautiful table, beautiful views, beautiful setting. The weather was just perfect and the vibe of the outdoor patio was happy.Our waiter was very professional and all other front of house staff were as well. Some were friendlier than others but in a very understated way, which I appreciated. Napkins were folded when people left their seats, water and wine were refilled without ever having to ask.Unfortunately, when our main dishes food came out, only one dish was hot and the other three were lukewarm.I asked for mine to be corrected but when it came out again, the bowl was warmed but the food was still not hot. I'm guessing it was a kitchen timing mistake, that the three dishes waited too long for the fried dish which came out piping hot and delicious. The wait between our two courses was extremely long which also points to a possible kitchen timing issue.Overall, we were happy with our experience but the food temperature fail was a pretty big one given it's a restaurant and successful food delivery should be a major component.The appetizers we ordered were delicious--fluke crudo and the calamari. The main course that came out hot (fish and chips) was delicious. And I'm guessing if the other three dishes had come out hot, they'd have been delicious as well.Very much appreciated an on the house dessert to mark the occasion. Hospitality is on the mark.Was a shame that the main entree food temperature was the disappointing element in an otherwise very nice evening.","89 South St New York, NY 10038"

Our meal featured a delectable array of seafood appetizers. However, the unfortunate outcome was that the following morning, all of us experienced gastrointestinal discomfort. While this led to a bout of discomfort marked by digestive issues, thankfully, we all recovered within a span of 24 hours.Although the incident was not a major concern, I took the initiative to reach out to the restaurant to share my experience. This gesture stemmed from my genuine fondness for the place. The receptionist was understanding, expressed sympathy, and kindly took down my email and phone number. I was assured that someone, possibly even the chef, would get in touch with me.I made it clear that my intention was not to seek any form of compensation but rather to provide the establishment with feedback. To my disappointment, no one has reached out to me, and this has left me disheartened by the level of service received. Despite my initial desire to revisit the restaurant, this experience has cast a shadow over my enthusiasm.I had hoped for a more responsive approach, as I genuinely value the restaurant and its offerings.

2023-08-08,2023-09-16,Gatsby's Landing Times Square,"As a patron of their Roslyn location, I was excited to try their TImes Square venue while in the city seeing a Broadway show.  It was a perfect NYC day, with warm weather yet no humidity and that oddly strange take on ""fresh"" air that only New York can offer.  We made a reservation and were greeted promptly, given the choice of indoor or outdoor seating.  Since we couldn't decide, the host said, ""How about a compromise"" and sat us as a cozy table for two right at the opening of the door--the best of both worlds, as we were neither fully inside nor fully outside.  Our server, Joey, came right over and introduced himself.  He was super attentive, jovial, and a pleasure to engage with.THE GROWS:  The bathrooms are super tiny.  But it's NYC and they weren't located in the basement, so that's a plus.THE GLOWS:  The service and attentiveness of all staff we encountered would be reason enough to return.  While it was relatively busy, we were not rushed.  For my appetizer I chose the grilled eggplant with mozzarella stack, adorned with fresh pomodoro sauce.  For my entree, I ordered the Gatsby Burger, which came with the choice of fries or salad.  I opted for the salad, which consisted of fresh greens and a delicious dressing.  The ""special sauce"" that topped the burger was worthy of merit.  When it came time for dessert, we were both full but wanted coffee.  Joey offered us the choice of cappuccino as well.  I asked, thinking it was a long shot, if they had almond milk.  THEY DID!  I was able to comfortable enjoy my cappuccino and round out a terrific meal.Great value and quality in a very convenient location--highly recommend!","120 West 44th St New York, NY 10036"

While I enjoyed my omelette, I loved the bite I had of that burger.  Service was perfect and our early lunch was definitely a classy experience amidst a gritty feeling Times Square.","120 West 44th St New York, NY 10036"

The food was mediocre.  Definitely nothing special but more expensive than any of our other dinners this week. Notable was a $42 Charcuterie board that was fairly simple with meat and cheese selections,the toast addition was 4 half slices of a plain white bread with grill marks. A few grapes with some cheese and meat. Compare it to Trinity's by WTC that we had last night for $24 dollars that included pickles, jam, olives and a better bread with the standard meat and cheese. Our server, Kobe, was efficient and friendly as was the host. There were some food runners that seemed to be bored with the whole process. They certainly weren't happy to be there.

I ordered the beef bourginion which was tough on the outside and cooked perfect in the center and some were so over cooked it was hard to cut as many of us ordered this. They probably rested too long. The sauce was a touch salty for me otherwise pretty good. My piece was cooked better than others at my table.,"137 Eldridge St New York, NY 10002"

The place is really comfortable for seating and the waiters were accommodating to our needs. The happy drinks were good deals to get. The meals were very disappointing in my opinion because the beef stew meat was very dry and it shouldn't be like that. And the onion soup was too watery and didn't have much flavor to it. I hope that they do a better job next time.","137 Eldridge St New York, NY 10002"

Several of us ordered that dish and my friend couldn't finish it so she gave it to her bf. I never let food go to waste so I ended up using the sauce from another dish and it made it so much better. The beef was tender but a little salty but I was told that's normal.,"137 Eldridge St New York, NY 10002"

Our entree of the beef and the surf and turf was not enough for two people. Me and my friend ordered more. The staff was super friendly. So we ordered another appetizer and entree. The octopus and shrimp entree with the foie gras appetizer. We still think the appetizers were the best part of the dinner. The entrees were disappointing. The lava cake dessert was more like a chocolate bread with tiny bit of chocolate inside. The music was a bit loud and it felt like we were in a club. Hard to hear each other. The surf and turf the scallops were warm but the pork belly on it was cold. The size of the octopus in the entree was tiny compare to the salad.

It was the only food that I ate that day (except for toast- which is a very unlikely culprit). Within 10ish hours of eating the sushi, I was very ill (nausea, vomiting, etc.). The bout of food poisoning lasted 24 hours. I am very confident the poisoning was from this restaurant.

I ordered a beer, a bowl of udon, and a spicy tuna and miso black cod hand roll.This was perhaps the best meal I had during my short trip to NYC. The udon was full of flavor and came with generous portions of beef and noodles. The hand rolls were delicious and you could really taste the quality of ingredients.Overall, I had a great experience. The menu had an array of food and beverage options. The interior is very clean, but it can get pretty loud during peak hours.

2023-08-28,2023-09-16,DOMODOMO - New York,"Domodomo was one of the original hand roll restaurants in NYC. Since opening they've expanded the menu and have several locations in NY and NJ. They offer the best bang for your buck omakase aptly titled ""Domokase.""Priced at $102, this course menu consists of 8 courses.Chawanmushi - ikura, shio kombu, truffle oil, we added Uni for an additional $10. A good starting dish, the ikura and Uni tasted fresh. We liked the addition of the truffle oil.Kanpachi, Seasonal Oyster With Yuzu Foam, Seasonal Fish - the Kanpachi was delicious, I'm not into oysters though I did like the addition of yuzu foam, I forgot what the seasonal fish was but it was good.Yellowtail Carpaccio - very good.8 pieces of nigiri - the nigiri was fresh and all 8 were good. The salmon was our favorite.Miso Black Cod - this was the best dish of the meal. A nice sized portion of fish cooked perfectly with a kabocha purée.Shrimp Tempura Hand Roll - of course a place known for hand rolls delivers. You have 10 options to choose from for course menu.Matcha Ice Cream With White Chocolate Sauce - I feel many times the dessert course of an omakase is an afterthought. In the case of Domodomo this simple scoop of matcha ice cream mixed with the white chocolate sauce was excellent. You have the choice to pick one of 4 desserts offered.Unlike most Omakase's the service keeps it moving. You could find it to be a bit rushed but it's sometimes nice to be in and out of a spot within an hour.Domodomo is a great spot to get an excellent Omakase meal without breaking the bank.","140 W Houston St New York, NY 10012"

The flavors were fresh and the textures are glorious.We started with oysters and then got the Sushi & Handroll Course with spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail, uni pasta, and the miso black cod. This was the perfect amount of food for two people.The oysters came with this gooey lime sauce.The uni pasta is unlike anything I've ever had. It was a wonderful swirl of Asian squid ink flavors and cheddar sauce covering the thick noodles topped with a soft crunchy uni. It smelled like mac and cheese nearly, so yummy.The hand rolls came out looking like little sushi tacos. The spicy salmon roll had crunchy potato chips on top. The spicy yellow tail was so fresh and crisp.","140 W Houston St New York, NY 10012"

We ordered:Miso Black Cod - average sized portion for the price but very tastyHandrolls - we got the spicy scallop, spicy crab, spicy salmon, and miso black cod hand rolls. Handrolls were a great size and I only needed about 3 to feel full. My favorite was the spicy scallop. Only downside was that the spicy crab has a hard shell which makes it harder to eat since it starts to break apart as you bite it","140 W Houston St New York, NY 10012"

2023-08-24,2023-09-16,DOMODOMO - New York,"DOMODOMO is one of my favorite spots for omakase (or domokase, as they call it) in the city. This downtown spot is chic, modern, and quite spacious on the inside, with a variety of different rooms. Service is always extremely attentive and knowledgeable, which enhances the experience.I always opt for the domokase. On my most recent visit, this included a chawanmushi, a Japanese egg custard topped with ikura (red caviar). This dish was actually one of my favorites of the evening. Very delicate and complex.This was followed by a trio of amuse-bouche sized items: an oyster topped with yuzu foam, a smoked fish topped with a lemon vinaigrette, and a yellowtail carpaccio that was bright and tasty. Of the three though, the oyster was my personal favorite.Next came the chef's choice of assorted seasonal sushi. Each one was uniquely different but my favorite was the uni, which tasted super fresh and had that perfect umami salty-sweetness.The miso black cod came out next, which was served with a kobocha puree and mustard seed. While this was perfectly lovely, it paled in comparison to the cooked entree I had the first time I visited (a grilled octopus with maitake mushrooms).Finally, you get your choice of hand roll. I went with the oyster mushroom, per the server's recommendation and it was delicious. I also added on a lobster hand roll which was probably my favorite bite of the evening.For dessert, I opted for the black sesame panna cotta. This nutty, earthy dessert was a standout for me on my last visit and it didn't disappoint this time either.Overall, for $102, this omakase is one of the most cost-effective options in the city.

2023-07-27,2023-09-16,Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"This market is both handy and a hell of loudness and indoorness.Handy, because you can choose among a large selection of well defined gastronomic options (that constitute a section of the corporate ecosystem of mainstream trends). This allows to get a fast feeling of where corporates are.The Time Out Market has no windows, it is quite noisy and weirdly lighted -kind of disco light-. Definitively not the kind of atmosphere I feel inspired by.However, Jacob Pickle's corner -a franchise of the large and super successful restaurant on the upper west side- repeats the formula of fried chicken + with lots of calories of indulgent tasty but unhealthy yummyness. The menu is reduced, proportional to their small space at the market, but contains the brand''s signature orders. The fried chicken sandwich with mushroom sauce, the Mac and cheese, and the burger are safe classics where JP show by comparison with average general level how good they are.Nice, but stressed service.Ultimately, better to order that to actually come here.","55 Water St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

It had 2 huge slabs of fried chicken on top with a side of a biscuit. I was able to eat what I think was a third of it. Hubby also went for some but was full from eating his entire sandwich. We also ordered a side of pickles which didn't really stick out for me. They were sour and crunchy as I had expected but not worth an entire side.So why did I drop some stars? I had to toss the remaining salad which hurt my heart and wallet. I wish they would offer smaller portions.

The staff continuously showed such hospitality throughout my party's arrival and throughout my friend's birthday celebration. The ambiance was a low lit large open room with high ceilings, with a bar area and a pleasant space to converse, never getting too loud or hard to hear.Our server Howard walked us through the wine and cocktails list and also let us know about the Restaurant Week menu which we weren't aware of but was very similar to their standard Dinner menu - we opted to share more larger dishes instead of each of our party of 5 selecting an antipasti, entree, and dessert separately.My favorite was the wild & foraged mushrooms with prosciutto and a poached egg. This was so flavorful and a perfect bite. The crispy artichokes and the zucchini blossoms were good as well, but I'd definitely try another antipasti next time.I enjoyed both pastas, they were al dente which is my preference. There was a decent portion in itself as well as lobster and sauce in each! The veal Parmesan is beautifully presented.I'll definitely be back, there is a Happy Hour!","100 E 19th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-01,2023-09-16,Carlotto,"Food 7/10Decent Italian food, but it wasn't insanely good. Solid flavors, good for a work meal. The pastas came out a little too lukewarm for my liking, and the bread was a bit hard. Nevertheless, I really liked the seafood pasta, as the dough had the perfect amount of bounce, it was beautifully al dente, and filled with SO MUCH seafood.Atmosphere 10/10Gorgeous interior, newly opened restaurant.Service 7/10A little confusing on explaining the menu, as it was restaurant week, and no pricing was listed for individual dishes, and we didn't want to order the restaurant week set.","100 E 19th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-30,2023-09-16,Carlotto,"This place is fairly new. Inside is very modern with an open kitchen. Appetizers and pasta were super tasty. Entree and risotto fell a little short. Veal Parmesan was huge. Wish it was a bit thicker and with more sauce. Risotto was too watery and little bland. I specially love the beef carpaccio, octopus, and the lobster pasta. The beef was so tender, and the creaminess of the cheese along with the truffle together was like a party in mouth. The octopus was cooked perfectly, and the green bean with basil pesto really complimented it. Who doesn't like a good al dente lobster pasta, which Carlotto delivered. It's definitely one of the best Italian I had for a while.","100 E 19th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-19,2023-09-16,Carlotto,The pasta here is house made.  Particularly good was the rigatoni and the casareece di mare.  Also good was the casareece di mare and the zucchini blossems.  for discsert we had the strawberries with zabaglione and the affograto.  Service and ambiance were good.,"100 E 19th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-17,2023-09-16,Carlotto,"Carlotto is a new elegantly decorated, spacious Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. I had a reservation for two on a Wednesday evening. Prior to arriving, it made it seem like we could only do the restaurant week menu during restaurant week. So I was surprised when the hostess asked us which menus we wanted to try. To make it easier, we stuck with the restaurant week menu, which was a 3 course affair for 60 dollars.For the appetizer, we shared the wild and foraged mushrooms and the zucchini blossom. They were both very good! I thought the zucchini blossom was very well done. The mushrooms were good but not as good as the mushroom app at L'artusi.For the main, we both opted for the pasta dishes. The portion size was decent. I enjoyed my tagliatelle and my friend liked her spicy rigatoni.The dessert menu was sad in comparison to the actual dessert menu on the regular menu. They gave you 2 actual dessert options of the adffogato al cafe and a summer berries dish.What was also interesting was when I calculated how much we would've paid for the 3 courses on the regular menu, it seemed to cost less than 60 dollars.For example, wild mushrooms 16 + spicy rigatoni 26 + affogato 12 for a total of 54 dollars..... so somehow for restaurant menu, we paid more than what we would've if we had just ordered from the regular menu. I didn't notice until writing this review to look up what we ordered. I kind of feel stupid now.But the food and ambiance were good enough to try at least once but maybe double check the actual prices of the courses you want on the restaurant menu and see if you can order them off the regular menu.","100 E 19th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-06,2023-09-16,Carlotto,"Delicious delicious delicious! The pasta is fresh, the sauces are amazing, the focaccia was perfect. My husband is still raving about the mafaldine.

The food is absolutely delicious. Cocktails are sumptuous. Service was 5 stars.  Overall, if I lived around the corner, I'd be in serious trouble because I would eat there 2-3x a week minimum! Go for the vibe, service and delicious Italian food.","100 E 19th St New York, NY 10003"

I'm extremely allergic and told the younger male staff worker that they should as least include a note, and he brushed me off and didn't apologize or offer any sympathy. Awful experience and never again.",

2022-07-21,2023-09-16,Taiwanese Yummy,"The popcorn chicken here is amazing! Transports me back to Taiwan! Very light and crispy with a savory dash of spices.The gua bao was good too, though I think they were rushing so the bun was falling apart a little bit. Still, the flavors were on point and I will look for this stand first at the next event!",
2022-06-20,2023-09-16,Taiwanese Yummy,"I went to the Seventh Heaven street fair in Brooklyn, and to my surprise, there was a whole block dedicated to Taiwanese culture! It was right next to Japan Fes.The line for Taiwanese Yummy was long the first time I walked through the fair (and deservedly so!). They had probably the most extensive menu of any of the Asian vendors - pork belly buns, fried squid, popcorn chicken, pork blood cake (!!!), Asian sausage,  and fried mackerel!I just went with a single pork belly bun (which was STUFFED), and also the fried squid (because I saw it had just come out of the fryer). It was all SO good. And reasonably priced as well (most things were $9). Not your typical street fair food!",

Service was great, food was slow to come but the drinks came quickly.We had the oysters, two pasta dishes, mushroom pate, tomatoes and cheese, and a few drinks. The food and drinks were all delicious. I especially loved the lamb pappardelle, the mushroom pate and spicy margarita. Pleasant atmosphere with great food and drinks.","127 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-07-23,2023-09-16,Colonie,What a lovely experience at Colonie yesterday!My friend and I came in right after the brunch rush and ordered the Cacio e Pepe eggs and the French toast. Both dishes were delicious. The eggs had so much flavor (as well as the dressing on the salad) + the hash browns were perfectly golden and crunchy.  The French toast wasn't overly sweet and the raspberry preserves were such a nice touch.Service: Server was really nice and the food ended up taking longer than it was supposed to and the manager put it on the house which was not expected and really sweet. I will definitely be going back and recommend. Thank you!!,"127 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-07-10,2023-09-16,Colonie,"Have pushed off going to colonie for the longest time & I truly don't know why! I've only been for brunch, but I'm sure dinner is just as delicious.TLDR: great brunch stop with attentive serviceFood: only came for the brunch. We ordered the scramble, eggs in purgatory, and Turkish eggs. Def recommend the latter two, the scramble was underwhelming in comparison. Was the perfect amount of food for 3 people but I'd definitely recommend a side of hash browns!Service: very attentive! They came by multiple times to fill up our water cups & replace our plates.Insider Tips: you can book ahead on Resy! But, if you're unable to, their brunch starts at 11 & doesn't really fill up til 11:30. If you can, sit in the back for a view of the kitchen.Good for: people you're trying to impressive!

2023-06-18,2023-09-16,Colonie,"The reservation was for 7:15pm and we were able to get seated early as we arrived at 7pm. The basics in providing water wasn't supplied for 20 minutes. When we ordered our non alcoholic drinks a coke ($4) and a garden party ($11) they were definitely at Manhattan pricing for little volume. The coke wasn't filled full and was served in a cocktail collins glassware. My garden party drink was served in a coupe glassware, refreshing but not worth the price even if it was ""farm to table"" ingredients of lime, cucumber and mint.Great open kitchen layout for patrons to see the cooks taking their time cooking leisurely with no regard for their customer's hunger or time. There were a fair amount of empty tables on a Sunday, one would think food should arrive at the table within a reasonable time. Waiting for our entrees took more than an 1.5 hour, by the time we got our food it was almost 9pm. Asking progress from the waiter who kept saying ""It will be ready in 5 minutes"" was unbecoming and unreliable. I was too hungry that I left to get outside food and drinks.The food that was ordered from our party was disappointing and mediocre (Pappardelle, Atlantic Hake, Tagliatelle, Pork Chop). Not worth the time, money or commute if you are outside a couple blocks from this restaurant. Unfortunately for us we travelled from Manhattan/Queens. There are plenty mediocre places in Manhattan for that price, flavour and service. The only positive feedback I feel I can give for this restaurant is the ambiance and choice of furnishings as their table arrangements were rustic and innovative in expanding and consolidating seating size.Moral of this post: If you are hungry or will be commuting to this restaurant do not bother coming, you'll be waiting endlessly to the point where you will leave your party to get your own food, and return to box up your disappointing mediocre food.","127 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-05-24,2023-09-16,Colonie,"I may have found my new favorite ""treat yourself"" dinner spot in the area - Colonie checked so many boxes for a phenomenal dining experience.The inside somehow feels intimate and open at the same time, with a spacious layout that takes advantage of the narrow floor plan in a smart way. And there's an open kitchen at the back, adding to the feeling of openness. They did a great job creating an inviting, warm atmosphere.I loved the simple menu, with a few choice selections for each category. I'm a fan of keeping things simple, trusting the restaurant to curate its own offering rather than making me select from an unruly list.For drinks, they have a variety of wines, a few beers on tap, and a number of interesting cocktails. I stuck to the chilled red wine that was available, and it was fantastic.For food:- The beet starter was outstanding. It was so unique to have roasted beets, rather than the usual ice cold approach. And they went perfectly with the yogurt and the sauce, giving a hearty, slightly sweet taste.- In contrast, the celery starter was light and citrusy, very balanced. They weren't shy about adding copious parmigiano, the plate had a ton of delicious solid cheese in every bite. The parmigiano went really well with the citrus and the dates in the dish.- The pappardelle was phenomenal. The pasta was al dente, the flavors were rich, and the braised lamb was very tender. I was worried that the rosemary would dominate, but the seasoning was perfect, and I enjoyed every bite.- The tagliatelle didn't stand out as much as the other three things we ordered, but still a good, simple pasta dish. Well prepared, but it didn't pack a ton of flavor like the rest of the meal.Service was excellent, I'll definitely be back next time I'm ready to splurge on a decadent meal that's expensive, but not exorbitantly so!","127 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"

I would definitely recommend reservations, even on a weekday evening! They were able to seat our table of 5 without an advanced reservation. We were so appreciative as it was a special celebration for us. The food was delicious and fresh. However, it did come out slowly so I would come here if you want to eat slowly and enjoy your time. We got a mix of small and large plates. I would recommend the roasted beets and sweet peas & burrata for small plates and any of the pasta dishes. We tried the pappardelle, tagliatelle, and campanelle. The Atlantic hake was also delicious. You can't go wrong with anything!","127 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"

I was amazed the fried spring rolls weren't greasy at all. Each spring roll was filled with minced pork, shrimp and veggies, with pickled carrot on the side. The fish sauce was completed with sweet, savory and zesty flavors, serving as a lovely accompaniment to the rolls.＊ Shaking Beef VermicelliThey used angus short ribs and I could really tell the difference as the meat was so tender and braised with black pepper sauce. There was also heaps of beef so I could enjoy my vermicelli with meat until the very last bite. All the veggies were fresh and complement well wish fish sauce. I shared it with my company but it was still hard to finish a bowl.＊ Lemongrass Porkchop Banh MiIt was good but not as spectacular as the other two. The baguette was on point with a crispy outer and a soft center. The grilled boneless porkchop was cooked to perfection - desirable meat-fat ratio, juicy and flavorful.****Cash onlyMy Recommendations:Spring Roll, Shaking Beef VermicelliWorth Returning ?

The interior is dark and moody, so would be a great date spot. Check comes directly to the table with the credit card reader.Beef Pho ($16) - this was a special off-menu, which struck me as weird that it wasn't on the permanent menu. The broth flavor was deep but it wasn't a entirely clean beef bone broth flavor - you can tell it was boosted with something. I agree with other reviews that says the broth isn't piping hot like it should be. Noodles and meat were cooked perfectly though. The bowl is just enough for one person.

The music was nice and everyone was friendly. We ordered downstairs and got escorted upstairs where the space really opened up to a high ceiling main dining room. Super clean, modern, and I love the individual tables as well as giant communal table in the middle! This space would also be great to work in as it is relatively quiet and spacious.We ordered a few dishes and they came out quickly and fresh! The salt and pepper chicken was juicy, crispy and reminded me of home! Probably my favorite salt and pepper chicken in the city now!! My friend ordered the pork chop and it was equally crispy yet tender and flavorful! The chicken and radish soup was perfectly clear and delicate. It perfectly cleared up my cold that was forming from being rained on earlier in the day! (Thanks a lot NYC weather ).All in all, 10/10 I will be coming back again to eat everything off the menu!

But 3.5 feels fair.Given the small likelihood we would trek to Bayside to visit the original Mama Lee, we decided to dine at this new Williamsburg location, which had opened seven weeks prior. We ordered the sanbeiji (three cups chicken) and the zhajiangmian. The sanbeiji, a signature dish in Taiwanese cuisine, was amazing and the best I'd ever had. The meat was perfectly crispy on the outside, yet tender inside. The sauce was also unusually spot-on--perfectly sweet and savory, and not too oily. However, the zhajiangmian was probably the worst I'd ever had at a restaurant. The ground pork and noodles were shockingly bland, as if the chef had drunkenly forgotten to add some key ingredients to enhance the flavor. This was a huge disappointment.The food is somewhat expensive for practically a fast-casual restaurant. We ordered at the front, and food was served quickly. I did appreciate the well-lit, clean, and minimalist ambience, as well as the Taiwan-related posters on the wall. I also appreciated that there were three high chairs available, comfortably accommodating my two children. Service was friendly. I was dubious about dining at the restaurant so soon after it had opened; hopefully the cooking will be more consistent and the menu will expand to include other favorites at the Bayside Mama Lee location.","66 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11249"
2023-08-10,2023-09-16,Mama Lee - Williamsburg,"We were craving Taiwanese food and were delighted to see we no longer have to drive all the way to Bayside for our favorite place! Mama Lee opened up this new location in Williamsburg and we were excited to try it. We went on a Friday night and figured we'd be taking our chances with parking. It wasn't bad at all as we found free street parking less than two blocks away!! The food did not disappoint. We ordered seven things off the menu. Everything was delicious; our favorites were the salt and pepper fried chicken, Taiwanese fried pork chop and of course, three cup chicken. The salt and pepper chicken came with a hot sauce that was AMAZING! (I was tempted to bring it home with me. Lol!) Their 3 braised eggs were the best I've ever had. Their portion sizes were large and more than enough for our party of five. The atmosphere was very comfortable, noise level was good and service was friendly. We will definitely be back again!","66 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11249"
2023-08-03,2023-09-16,Mama Lee - Williamsburg,"I've been to the Bayside location. The vibe is obviously very different. It's unique that it's a upscale fast casual place with nice dish ware set. Service is great.We got cucumber salad, and fried pork chop. Food portions are huge which is similar to Bayside. Probably better to go in a larger group to try more dishes.","66 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11249"
2023-07-24,2023-09-16,Mama Lee - Williamsburg,Being a big fan of the original mama Lee . This out post is nothing but disappointment.The Lou ru fan is basically a lean dry mince pork over rice . The meat has  no flavors and extremely dry even with the sauce that was provided and not to mention the rice that was served was cold and harden as it seem like it has been sitting out for 20 mins prior to serving.The 3 cup chicken was also way tone down in flavor and is served over fried chicken pieces like general tso chicken.Over all I would say this is more seems like a chipotle of Taiwanese food and not a good presentation of original mama lees cooking.,"66 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11249"
2023-07-22,2023-09-16,Mama Lee - Williamsburg,Excellent Taiwanese food. Superb service. Lively atmosphere. Nice to see a place like this in Williamsburg.,"66 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11249"
2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Red Hook Tavern,"Getting to Red Hook Tavern is quite the trek coming from Upper Manhattan, especially if you want to use public transportation, but it's well worth the effort. We arrived at the restaurant half an hour past our reservation time, and to our delight, they graciously held our table for us. We all ordered the infamous burger and it was everything you'd anticipate from a $30 burger--absolutely phenomenal. It was simple and topped with just cheddar and a slightly grilled onion, yet incredibly delicious and I wouldn't change a single thing about it.","329 Van Brunt St Brooklyn, NY 11231"
2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Red Hook Tavern,"This spot has an unreal menu. You can tell they've put countless hours into each dish to ensure it's perfectly delicious, unique, and balanced. That burger nearly made me cry. The wine selection is phenomenal. The staff are super friendly and make great recommendations.Truly - impossible to go wrong on that menu.","329 Van Brunt St Brooklyn, NY 11231"
2023-09-06,2023-09-16,Red Hook Tavern,"Red Hook, Brooklyn isn't easy to get to.  But it's a really cool spot that makes you feel like you've found some sort of hidden island outside of Manhattan.  And the easiest way to get there is probably going to pier 11/Wall Street.  The ride is quick and then you're within about 2/10 of a mile of this restaurant once you're at the Red Hook terminal.This place is pretty popular, so reservations through Resy are recommended.  They have a lot of outdoor seating, but indoor seating is more limited, with a long wooden bar and maybe 10 tables and a booth or two.They have a succinct menu, which includes fish n chips, oysters, salad, cavatelli.  I had their well know tavern burger, which was quite good.  I've had a lot of good burgers, so I'm not sure I could say it's the best I've ever had (that honor probably belongs to The Golden Diner on the LES), but it was juicy, cooked just right, super hot and cheesy.  Great char on the outside.  The chips that came with it were fantastic!  I really liked them--fries, but cut with a mandoline slicer.  Hot and well seasoned.I also had the ham and cheese coquettes (please realize this is way too much food and you shouldn't ask for both alone unless you want leftovers).  They have gooey aged cheddar--so gooey and tangy I almost thought it was pimento cheese--and a crispy outside.They have a nice cocktail list to satisfy all tastes with a variety of spirits (gin, vodka, whiskey, tequila) with lots of interesting herbs, fruits, and accompaniments.  I even had one interesting drink with charred onion.  They also have wine and beer,Service was attentive.  She gave great suggestions.  The place had a laid back vibe.  Worth the ferry ride!","329 Van Brunt St Brooklyn, NY 11231"
2023-09-04,2023-09-16,Red Hook Tavern,"Red Hook Tavern, oh boy, where do I even begin with this delightful spot? It's the kind of place where the food is so good that it'll make your taste buds want to do the cha-cha. So, folks, let's dive into this hilarious and mouthwatering review!First things first, let's talk about the food.

Now, you might think that cute employees would be a plus, but oh no, they're a disappointment, apparently! They're so cute that they're distracting, and you'll find yourself trying to order with a stutter that rivals a Looney Tunes character. But hey, it's a small price to pay for such delightful food.Now, let's address the elephant in the room - prices. Brace yourselves, folks, because the prices at Red Hook Tavern are reasonable.

2023-08-30,2023-09-16,Red Hook Tavern,"Completely forgot to take pictures this time but will still write about my experience...walked in on a Friday afternoon and it was packed. How do New Yorkers make money if they're not working in a random mid-day? I guess I can I can say the same for me...Anyway the tavern had fast and polite service which is always a plus! The ambience reminds you of a pub and it's pretty informal.I got the burger and the country ham croquettes as appetizer. I really liked the croquettes - cheesy, melting in your mouth, crispy on the outside. The burger is chunky and I liked it but it was a bit overcooked/overgrilled on the outside which made it weirdly crusty with charbroil, so I will not give it a 5 stars (go to Minetta Tavern for a 5-star one!)","329 Van Brunt St Brooklyn, NY 11231"
2023-08-04,2023-09-16,Red Hook Tavern,Worst experience I've ever had at a New York restaurant. We put our name down at 7:30 and at 10:15 pm they told us they would not be able to seat us and the kitchen is closed. They easily could have turned us away earlier in the night. Extreme disappointment and worst service.,"329 Van Brunt St Brooklyn, NY 11231"
2023-08-04,2023-09-16,Red Hook Tavern,"Do not go here. You put your name in there they never text you then tell you the kitchens closed. We put our name in 3 hours ago then they tell you they messed up. When we put our names down they said an hour then an hour goes by and they say another hour so we wait then they say the kitchen is closed. DO NOT GO HERE THE HOST IS COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT OF SITTING OR HOSTING. If I could leave a 0 star review I would, this is completely unacceptable.","329 Van Brunt St Brooklyn, NY 11231"
2023-08-01,2023-09-16,Red Hook Tavern,"Great spot only tried the burger which was very average for the price of $29. Not sure if they cooked it with other food on the grill but I still felt the same aftertaste from the burger the rest of the day which really turned me off. Place has a good atmosphere. However, I sat outside and was being harassed by bees and flies the entire meal. Not ideal if you have bee allergies to sit outside given their floral decore.","329 Van Brunt St Brooklyn, NY 11231"
2023-07-25,2023-09-16,Red Hook Tavern,"Get the burger. You won't leave disappointed. They also have a pretty extensive drinks list - with good local beers on tap if you're into that sort of thing. Try to make your reservations in advance though, as tables go quickly. We sat outside under the awning and were comfortable, but I'd probably opt for inside next time to get the true ambiance.","329 Van Brunt St Brooklyn, NY 11231"
2023-09-13,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,"Beautiful restaurant, romantic ambiance. Pricey but perfect for special occasions. Staff is kind and top notch. Our water glasses were always full.Food was complex and delicious. The fish is fresh - we got the mini chirashi tasting bowls - so beautiful.The crispy rice roll can be skipped imo, as well as the pickle assortment.We got the potato salad which was good, topped with a jammy hard boiled egg. The braised pork belly melts in your mouth. Yum! Enjoyed dining here.Only complaint is it's one of those restaurants where the tables are fairly close together, it feels like you dine with the couples next to you...","47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"
2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,"Definitely an aesthetic sushi spot with great quality fish, tasty cocktails, and great service! The interior is perfect for a nice brunch or dinner - brightly lit and decorated with vibrant green furniture. Our hostess was very friendly when we walked in, and we were checked in on often by our waitress.It seemed like the momoya box was the most popular, so my friends and I all ordered it and thoroughly enjoyed each bite. At first glance, it may not seem like that much food but it is very filling for sure. I could not finish the rice for the last few bowls. The rice is very flavorful and has bits of crab meat(?) in it. My favorite was the otoro (obviously) and uni bowls.The cocktails are worth ordering! I will say it does come out to be a pretty expensive bill even if you are just dining in for lunch.","47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"
2023-09-09,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,Food was ok but really expensive for what it wasI liked the salmon roll but otherwise was underwhelmed,"47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"
2023-08-29,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,"We went to Momoya SoHo for a quick snack as a party of 2: me and my son.We were there during restaurant week and ordered their wagyu lunch menu and decided what the heck- let's try their infamous sushi box (not part of resto week) and their even more infamous parfait!They were just opening up for dinner at 5 and made our reservations via app. Greetings were warm and service was unpretentious and attentive.The wagyu lunch was served in timed and good tasting portions. Well seasoned wagyu, very delicate and tender. The miso is good miso soup, the matcha dessert was real matcha.Our sushi box was def a instagrammable but more importantly it was also high quality fish that was presented and all seasoned perfectly with sides and spices.The star of the show is The Parfait. You are given a ""map"" of the glass and alllll its entirety! The way we did it was to start from the top and work our way to the bottom. Each layer (16 LAYERS) was sooo good I cannot describe it enough-  you can tell that a lot of thought went into each piece of the dessert, nothing was an afterthought.  My son and I were chuckling and it was a great experience to see what we were eating and savoring each bite.Would recommend this for anything- a snack , a date, a quick lunch, or even for just their seasonal  Parfaits.","47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"

2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,"Momoya Soho is a pretty touristy sushi spot based on the people here but it is still really good IMHO and definitely worth a try.  My girlfriend and I ordered some sushi and the yuzu pancakes to share.  The sushi was fresh albeit portions could've been bigger for the price.  The Yuzu pancakes do take some time to make (which our server did let us know) but are well worth the wait.  They are so fluffy and tasty, it's understandable to get the hype around Japanese soufflé pancakes.  We did not get that epic looking ""for the gram"" parfait but maybe next time.  Do note that if you do a yelp check-in you do get 10% off your order!  All in all, Momoya Soho is a solid spot for sushi and Japanese brunch items (I got my eyes on the molten matcha lava toast next)!","47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"
2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,Went here for lunch on my anniversary and they were very sweet and had great attention to detail as they immediately gave us a glass of Champagne to celebrate!

2023-08-27,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,"Came here for lunch and got the ""Sushi Lunch"" order. 5 pretty small pieces of sushi (only 3 different kinds though: 2 tuna, 1 yellowtail, 2 salmon) and 2 rolls of choice. Sushi was average - nothing exciting, but not terrible. Also got the souffle pancakes - which were rather dry unfortunately. Wasn't anything to really come back for, but decent service.","47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"
2023-08-25,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,"Lots of fun traditional but modernized Japanese dishes and small plates. Tuna tartar, meatballs, and omakase bento were innovative and perfect. Loved everything we ordered. The summer dessert parfait stole the show, with perfectly balanced flavors that weren't too sweet. So many surprises. Chill but also fun ambiance.","47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"
2023-07-12,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,Seriously great Japanese cuisine. Crispy rice was a highlight. The seasonal dessert parfait in particular was a nice surprise and was soulfully made. $28 was a reasonable price for the artistry and complexity of the parfait.,"47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"
2023-08-25,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,"Came back for Restaurant Week, and while food is still very good, value has gone down. If I had ordered a la carte, my sushi entree, miso soup, and dessert would have come out to $60 anyway. Last years restaurant week included the mini bowl box, which made it a good value. It this price point, service should be immaculate, but it's....not. We had to wait so long for someone to come out and take our order that's my friend had to go inside and tell the host stand we were ready. Once our waitress finally arrived, things got a lot better, but how do you seat guests and then not assign staff to that area?","47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"
2022-08-20,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,"5 stars for the food, minus two stars for uneven service and an overcharge. Food at brunch is totally worth going for, but the service needs some work and did not match the excellent experience I previously had at dinner.I didn't realize that they were doing restaurant week for Saturday brunch, so we were pleasantly surprised that we were able to get in on the sushi special. At $30, 8 pieces of nigiri and a spicy salmon roll, was a good deal and also came with an appetizer. For the appetizer, chose the fried fish and were a little miffed that it was more like a fish cake, very small and not that tasty. The sushi made up for it and was fresh and delicious.My friend and I couldn't decide on sweet or savory so decided we would get one of each and share. When we ordered the souffle pancakes, our waitress told us that it could take an hour. This was odd as there was no such warning on the menu and the pancakes ended up coming out well before the sushi, which we wanted to course out and eat first. The pancakes were absolutely delicious though.I also wanted to try a summer parfait dessert, but when we tried to order it, we were initially shut down because apparently the jelly for it isn't ready until later in the day. Very odd because it is on the menu we received when we sat down and again there is no warning that it's not available at a certain time. This was initially very disappointing as the parfait and pancakes were my reason for coming for brunch there. After we paid our bill, my friend and I sat around chatting for another 20-30 minutes and then saw the next table over get a parfait! We asked the waitress if we could start a new tab and decided to order two parfaits but it would have been nice if she had informed us that the parfaits were ready because we would have missed it if the other table hadn't ordered theirs. The parfait was worth the wait though-- it was a gorgeous work of culinary art, and the flavors and textures were sublime. Definitely get one!When we settled the tab, I noticed we were charged $21 for each parfait, which felt high in the moment but at that point we were just ready to go and I didn't look too much into it. When I got home I checked the prices on the restaurant menu and see it was $18 there and in a recent Eater write up. Yes, I should have checked while still at the restaurant, but I didn't expect the need to do that at a restaurant of this caliber and the overcharge left a bit of a bad taste after an otherwise wonderful meal, service issues aside. At this price point, everything should be buttoned up.Outdoor seating is still nice and plentiful. Restroom is still accessible and clean.","47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"
2022-08-06,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,"Fantastic Restaurant Week experience! My friend and I both got the karaage chicken, shared the bento and chirashi bowl boxes, and tried the I've cream sandwich for dessert. Everything was delicious, and I would highly commend the box with the chirashi bowls for a future visit as it had a great variety of sashimi including delicacies like fatty tuna and uni. At $60 for three courses, this was a steal.We sat outside on a covered patio. It was super cute and had views of a beautiful church. There is a small threshold to get on the patio but nothing my wheelchair couldn't handle.Service was attentive and friendly.Accessibility: no barriers to go inside from the street. There is an ADA bathroom all the way at the back of the restaurant. The door opens a bit too close for comfort to an open staircase but a staff person went with me to ensure I could safely make it past so it was okay.","47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"

They've been open 3 weeks but I guess they haven't gotten the word out. I walked by before they opened and was invited in for a tour by Dora's brother Oscar. We were 3 tonight for dinner to give it a try and ordered an appetizer of steamed mussels, ceviche Mixto and a skirt steak. We were surprised all the food came out at the same time, but everything was delicious. Ceviche could've been a little more tangy and the steak more tender but we all enjoyed sharing the meal that only set us back $35pp.They offer a varied menu with about 7 different kinds of ceviche and mostly seafood appetizers. We were thinking when we go back to get the ceviche as appetizers and have a steak and a pasta dish.","40 Ave B New York, NY 10009"

As you can see in my bill, I ordered a regular coffee with a shot of espresso and with Tax and tip i ended paying over $12 for a lukewarm coffee.More than at the Ritz.Needless to say, I also paid $20 for a couple of sunny side-up eggs with a little bit of green salsa spread on top.I do not recommend this place at all because it's bad and expensive.","50 Carmine St New York, NY 10014"
2023-08-21,2023-09-16,Jack's Wife Freda,"I agree with other Yelpers - the portion size is quite small here in comparison to what they are charging.This place is expensive overall. The food is quite average and nothing quite special to pay that much. Even their mint lemonade and cantaloupe juice is $10 - quite a rip off!!The poached egg on grilled halloumi was nice. The burger was quite average and French fries were nice.The service is a bit slow in comparison to other restaurants in NYC. But they were super nice in their behaviour.The ambience could be quite loud!! I think this is one of the noisiest restaurants I have been to in the city. But of course you get immune to it after sometime. They had even put a table at the front door, covering like half of the entrance.

The zucchini chips were amazing and a good portion. I got the mashed avocado on bread with a piece of halloumi ($4 more). It was good and I was glad it came with French fries otherwise it wouldn't have been enough food. The waitress taking care of our group was great. Fast with the water refills. I got something on my dress and she saw and brought me soda water to clean it. I would come back.,"50 Carmine St New York, NY 10014"

We had reservations and were seated immediately even though two of us got in later   Service was AMAZING. Our server Ash was very helpful and attentive. I had the green shakshuka and loved it. When Ash saw me dipping the last piece of the extremely delicious challah bread into the sauce he asked me if I wanted more bread and promptly came out with a hot piece for my dipping enjoyment! Everyone was extremely happy with their food and service. We got chocolate cake and caramel cheesecake for desert, both were absolutely delicious! My desert came with the birthday candle and the whole restaurant joined in singing happy birthday! We all had a wonderful time. The price was a bit high ($10 for a lemonade) , added up to about $50 per person for brunch including tax and tip, a bit on the high side but we truly enjoyed the food and ambience, and most of all the friendly and attentive service","50 Carmine St New York, NY 10014"

2023-07-31,2023-09-16,Naked Dog,Great pasta dishes! Very fresh and homemade! The bread provided was a bit cake-y and not what I was expecting.

He made me a sweet but strong espresso martini with a hint of caramel if I remember well. The food was amazing. The flavor in both dishes was too good and it was ready quickly and was hot... just how i like it. I'm saying that because a lot of restaurants i've visited recently haven't served me hot food, but warm which disappoints me each time. I have recommended here to a few people already and I won't stop.","47 Java St Brooklyn, NY 11222"

2023-04-28,2023-09-16,Naked Dog,"Classic elevated Italian food in north Brooklyn. We ventured out here Friday night based on a friend's recommendation and it didn't disappoint. Right when we were seated we were given a side of focaccia. We had to stop ourselves from not devouring this to save some for our entrees.Altogether we shared the insalata, spigola, and the agnolotti. I always like to get some greens with my meal, and the mixed greens was a good starter. Personally I loved the agnolotti. It tasted so bright and fresh and I loved the addition of corn. The spigola which is a pan seared sea bass was cooked really well. It came with couscous, olives and tomatoes and it made it a really well rounded meal.The ambience in this place is so cozy. This would be a lovely place for a date.","47 Java St Brooklyn, NY 11222"

2023-08-29,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,"We went to Momoya SoHo for a quick snack as a party of 2: me and my son.We were there during restaurant week and ordered their wagyu lunch menu and decided what the heck- let's try their infamous sushi box (not part of resto week) and their even more infamous parfait!They were just opening up for dinner at 5 and made our reservations via app. Greetings were warm and service was unpretentious and attentive.The wagyu lunch was served in timed and good tasting portions. Well seasoned wagyu, very delicate and tender. The miso is good miso soup, the matcha dessert was real matcha.Our sushi box was def a instagrammable but more importantly it was also high quality fish that was presented and all seasoned perfectly with sides and spices.The star of the show is The Parfait. You are given a ""map"" of the glass and alllll its entirety! The way we did it was to start from the top and work our way to the bottom. Each layer (16 LAYERS) was sooo good I cannot describe it enough-  you can tell that a lot of thought went into each piece of the dessert, nothing was an afterthought.  My son and I were chuckling and it was a great experience to see what we were eating and savoring each bite.Would recommend this for anything- a snack , a date, a quick lunch, or even for just their seasonal  Parfaits.","47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"
2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Momoya SoHo,"Momoya Soho is a pretty touristy sushi spot based on the people here but it is still really good IMHO and definitely worth a try.  My girlfriend and I ordered some sushi and the yuzu pancakes to share.  The sushi was fresh albeit portions could've been bigger for the price.  The Yuzu pancakes do take some time to make (which our server did let us know) but are well worth the wait.  They are so fluffy and tasty, it's understandable to get the hype around Japanese soufflé pancakes.  We did not get that epic looking ""for the gram"" parfait but maybe next time.  Do note that if you do a yelp check-in you do get 10% off your order!  All in all, Momoya Soho is a solid spot for sushi and Japanese brunch items (I got my eyes on the molten matcha lava toast next)!","47 Prince St New York, NY 10012"

2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Sanmiwago,"Stumbled upon this corner store, and got $8~ for 8 plump, crispy, and flavorful dumplings. I ordered the signature pork and yellow chive dumplings. The sauce it came in was not spicy-- a little tangy, a little oily. Do expect a wait if you're ordering takeout, as everything is made fresh. Would come back to try the noodle dishes.","90 Bowery New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-01,2023-09-16,Sanmiwago,"The food is fantastic! I had the pork rice bowl and my partner had the popcorn chicken and the flavors were just perfect. Savory, rich and the right amount of butter to cut the richness. I will be back because I need to try everything. Plus, the staff is super nice and helpful, the food comes out quickly, and the prices are affordable too. The K-pop and 90s pop playing on the speakers is a nice touch too.","90 Bowery New York, NY 10013"
2023-08-24,2023-09-16,Sanmiwago,"Unfortunately did not have a good experience. Got the chicken and Napa cabbage dumplings which did not have much flavor, texture of the dumpling wrapper was also average and did not have that satisfying chew traditional Taiwanese dumpling shops have. I got one of the small chicken feet side dishes which has a very spicy sichuan marinated flavor. It was quite chewy and difficult to eat, flavor actually was so spicy and bitter I could not finish the dish. Hopefully this was a bad night but for now I will look elsewhere for my dumpling fix.","90 Bowery New York, NY 10013"

Air con was not working. Two fan in either side of the room but was not helpful at all. My Friend and I ended up sitting directly in front of one of the fans just to not endure the space long enough to eat our food.Food: My friend and I both ordered the Taiwanese Pork Chop. For me: It was ok. Not to rave about. A little salty for me. But I have a very low sodium diet so, don't base this part on my taste buds.Drink: I had the Sago Pudding. This was also just Ok. Very thick. Should have taken a hint from the name to figure out it was more of a dessert than a drink. Also, wish it could have been a little colder.

2023-08-27,2023-09-16,The Office of Mr Moto,Very cool location and ambiance. Be prepared to have an unorthodox Omakase experience.

2023-08-11,2023-09-16,The Office of Mr Moto,"Definitely trying a little too hard. I'm generally not into a gimmick, and they really go hard with the gimmicks in terms of story...but there's no real follow through. Fun and hard to find fish doesn't really make up for the fairly bland presentation. Many dishes were bordering on flavorless. Service isn't really great either: despite a ratio of ten guests to five staff (three servers and two behind the sushi counter), our water managed to go empty several times. The lounge downstairs is almost like out of a horror movie. Drink menu is the same as in the restaurant. Perplexingly, the Aesop soap in the bathroom seems to have been refilled with what is definitely not Aesop soap. Not a big deal, but kind of funny.","120 Saint Marks Pl New York, NY 10009"

2023-08-07,2023-09-16,The Office of Mr Moto,"The Office of Mr. Moto is an elusive omakase dining experience due to the difficult nature in scoring a reservation. Reservations can only be made on the 1st of each month for the following month and are gone within minutes. There's only 2 slots per night (6pm and 8:30pm). They offer a 21 course omakase for $195 and have 2 tiers of alcohol pairings available. Overall it's a unique, pricey once in a lifetime experience worth going for the high quality fish and to celebrate a special occasion. Thanks to my wonderful husband for treating me to this memorable experience!This is the kind of omakase experience where there is no soy sauce dispenser in sight, fresh wasabi root is grinded, everything is brushed onto the nigiri by the chef, and white soy sauce is used. Fancy and legit. Mr. Moto takes pride in the intimate group experience - all sushi is made as a batch at the same time and the entire experience doesn't start until everyone is seated and has their personal beverage (making for some awkward 10-15 mins waiting when we're going to start).Only the counter seating will make this dining experience worth it. For the same price, the gallery seating is dark and impersonal.  All wait staff can speak fluent Japanese and can translate any questions you have for the chef. Once the alcohol kicks in, the chef is a rather amusing guy. Interestingly, both him and his sous chef drink beer while on the job. Speaking of alcohol, we did not go for the alcohol pairing as we didn't want to get overly full and distract the attention away from the sushi.There are certain aspects of this restaurant experience that can be rather confusing. The need to input the code for entry through their intercom is unnecessary when everyone shows up at the same time- it's more so for the 'gram. Who Mr. Moto is isn't made clear. The only mention of him is when they gather everyone within your time slot in the first hall by mentioning an a letter he wrote to his mother and to not touch any of the artifacts. What was was so memorable about his voyage in 1853? How did his travels exactly inspire the theme of this restaurant? Sounds like an attempt to throw a random storyline into the theme of the restaurant in an attempt to make it ""cool."" After your dinner is over, they open out the basement lounge to chill but at that point you have finished your alcohol and the restaurant is getting ready to close/prep for the next service. Again the basement is another fancy idea just for the 'gram- leather couches, self playing piano, floral black wall paper without much tie into how this has to do with Mr. Moto or Japanese culture in general.At the very end, they give you a wax sealed envelop featuring all the fish/dishes you ate for the day and a memorabilia postcard. They will deduct $100 per person off your bill to credit you back your deposit.The one dish that left an everlasting impression on me was their Hokkaido uni - amazingly sweet, fresh, and definitely no skimping. I also loved watching high quality toro being mashed into negitoro hand rolls.","120 Saint Marks Pl New York, NY 10009"
2023-07-29,2023-09-16,The Office of Mr Moto,I have had numerous omakase meals in NYC and this restaurant was truly a unique experience both from the perspective of the food and the ambiance.  There were many servings of fish that I have not had before and they were all deliciously prepared.  The restaurant space is small but intimate and curated like a museum with different pieces of Japanese history throughout the restaurant.The staff was very attentive and friendly from when you first walk through the door until the end of the meal.  It was also really helpful they had a dedicated person explaining every piece of fish we had while the chef was diligently preparing each piece.  There are many choices of omakase in NYC but this place is definitely one that should be on the top of the bucket list.,"120 Saint Marks Pl New York, NY 10009"

2023-07-27,2023-09-16,The Office of Mr Moto,"This was the best omakase experience I've ever had by far. I've been to so many ranging in prices and themes but this one felt the most authentic and immersive. Getting a reservation is a bit hard but I assure it's worth trying to secure one.If you manage to get one, you can an email that has a secret code you must decipher to use to enter. I had the same pairing with my meal and it was quite the journey.Every piece was so fresh and generously cut. My favorite was probably the fresh scallop that was shucked right in front of us. I'm not the biggest sake fan but every selection was delicious.The aesthetic for the restaurant also fit the theme so well. Downstairs was a beautiful lounge that had piano that played itself.The staff and the chef were super friendly and shared the traditions behind an authentic Japanese dining experience and it made me feel like I was back in Japan.

It is not a trendy restaurant. Maybe I'm too old for this, but it wasn't chic, or amusing. In the photographies it looks bigger. Our table was in a corner where we couldn't see the main attraction of the place, that is the ceiling. I'm very tired of throwing away money. Why am I gonna spend money in a place like this? Who are they, the fashionistas of the world?  Do I have to make them a favour and think that I am in a glitzy restaurant?  None of the above.The decor is ugly, the fake plants and plastic flowers.Mediocre food. We ordered an hamburger each because the menu was bad and expensive.We were feeling in a bar nor in a restaurant, the image of the waiters is terrible.I've never ben in a place with such a bad music, All night hard rock.The ambiance was boring. Now I get it, It is from the Tao Group. A corporative restaurant monster with lots of gigantic places.As you can see, dear reader, I didn't like or enjoy Le Cathedrale. And I wanted to have a good time. The cocktail was too sweet. Im sorry, I don't want to be mean spirited, but this was one of the worsts.

2023-08-26,2023-09-16,Temakase,"This place is good, but not great. The lunch special is nice - you can get three handrolls and three small crispy rice bites for $20. The spicy salmon was a bit too mushy (saw the chef squirting this out of a bottle, so who knows how fresh it was) and the spicy scallops were too slimy for my taste. The spicy tuna crispy rice wasn't anything special either but the truffle spicy Mayo on the side was really good. I didn't like how they charge $2 extra for side sauces like soy - especially when it's typically included at most sushi spots. However, everything came out really quickly and the sushi bar seating is nice - it's a decent spot for a quick lunch but I wouldn't rave about it.","157 Second Ave New York, NY 10003"

2023-07-04,2023-09-16,Temakase,"Pretty sure the five star reviews are fake. Came here because kazunori is closed on July 4th. Big mistake. Not sure if it was just that day specifically, but the fish used in each hand roll tasted off. There was an extra slimy coating to each piece. The toro also tasted extra fishy and the soy sauce was super salty. The rolls were also too special. There were too many extra ingredients to add taste or crunch that it took away from the fish instead. For any purists who enjoy a simpler palette, I wouldn't recommend this hand roll bar. Kazunori or Naminori is cheaper and tastier. The service was what you would expect. Average. I would say that the server was polite but didn't refill our waters. Didn't seem like she was busy either with only three couples in the whole bar.  Tipping is also automatically set to 20% which seems a bit much compared to the service we get. Kazunori doesn't require tipping and is cheaper so the whole tip situation was out of the norm for us. I would probably only come back if it's another holiday and I hated the person I'm eating with.","157 Second Ave New York, NY 10003"

The set menus are definitely a better deal than ordering a la carte as it comes out to $8-$10 per hand roll if you order individually. I ordered the 6 roll set menu for $37 and it was super filling. We had reservations and though the place didn't seem too busy around dinner time. Personal favorite was the spicy scallop and toro!","157 Second Ave New York, NY 10003"

2023-07-06,2023-09-16,Fulton Fish,"Tonight we had some great food at Fulton Fish, but a pretty uncomfortable meal to be honest.We first put our drinks order in, and after 15 minutes realized the waitress hadn't put our drinks order in. Nbd, But then I told her about my (legit) food allergy and she noted it. An app came out and appeared to have the thing im allergic all over it. So I asked the bartender facing us if it was ok. He was like oh god no don't eat that, then went back to the kitchen to check, couldn't exactly tell me the ingredients, another head bartender got involved and annoyed. We just said it's ok, and they took the plate away, I hadnt had any, no harm no foul. I mentioned it to her just so the next person didn't have an allergy issue, and she vehemently told me I was wrong and the food was safe. At this point I was too nervous to touch it, plus it already went back.Then the embarrassment really started. A chef, a manager, and someone else each individually in rapid succession came up to me to vouch for the server about the allergy. I was like guys this is fine, please stop making a scene. Other diners were stopping and listening and I just needed this to stop. It just did not feel like the place was not being managed properly and we got trapped in the middle of some beef between staff. At the end, we ordered a second round and they arrived after sitting at the end of the bar for a long long time. At this point, we had a concert to get to and just paid and left without the round.Please don't make people regret sharing their allergies - it's so embarrassing to have several people tell me yes and no at the same time then make a big deal out of the fact I didn't want to have an allergy attack tonight. Figure it out internally and move on.","96 South St New York, NY 10038"

2023-07-04,2023-09-16,Fulton Fish,"Yesterday was my first time checking out the Tin Building. Fulton Fish Co occupies a large part of the first floor, near the patisserie and flower stand. My friend had brought her cavapoo, so we weren't sure what the correct MO was to get some light bites and enjoy the ambience. Fortunately, the servers/hosts for Fulton Fish were very helpful! We had asked first if we could eat outdoors and what that process would be like, but they gleaned correctly that we just wanted to make sure my friend's dog wasn't in other diners' way...and they said, ""No worries, we have plenty of seats on the 'dog side' of the restaurant."" Not only is this my new favorite phrase, but I really appreciate when folks proactively and enthusiastically help you figure out a situation. +10 for Fulton Fish Co!Food and drink-wise, it is quite pricey. While the food was good, I wanted a little more for what I paid. For example, a glass of wine is around $17-19. Although the rosé we had was very good, even in NYC, you're usually only spending $12-14 for a glass at most, so I *felt that.* My friend and I were not super hungry, so we split the scallops and the sardines. My friend was expecting the sardines to be on toast already. Instead, the pieces of toast were very little and you had to dig the sardines out of the tin they came in. It was fine, but just a mismatch of expectations here. The scallops were very good - they had a little unexpected kick; I like how they prepared this!All in all, it was around ~$50 pp for a glass of wine and 2 small dishes. Perhaps if I had tried some of their large plates, I might be more impressed. Overall,  this  was a solid first foray to the Tin Building (and appreciate that it's dog-friendly). I'd love to explore some of the other eateries!","96 South St New York, NY 10038"

2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Chalong,"Cute place in Hell's Kitchen with good Thai food! It was a 3.5/5 for all the food I'd say -- we got the crab curry and massaman brisket. The crab curry was yummy and kind of spicy, which I loved. The crab itself was fresh and juicy. The massaman curry was strangely sweet? I wasn't expecting that since massaman is usually savoury and packed with spices. I think the dish was overall kind of flat and unlike thai dishes in their complexity.Given the plethora of delicious food in NYC, I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to visit , unfortunately :(","749 9th Ave New York, NY 10019"

If you don't mind the wait for good food it's worth it, but if you're like us who had a birthday dinner and a schedule that was derailed then I would keep wary.

2023-08-19,2023-09-16,Cafe Gitane,"4 stars for the charming room and wait staff3 stars for food overall0 stars for the cevicheI've been here for brunch three times. Each time it was a hot day and I wanted a light meal, not anything with meat or eggs.- On the first two occasions I ordered avocado toast. Like I said, I wasn't looking for anything complicated. It was fresh and flavorful. Did the job.- On the third time (and definitely the last time for me), the situation was basically the same. Hot day, looking for something light on the stomach. I was literally about to order the avocado toast again when I noticed ceviche on the menu. It was tuna. Never my first choice due to being so overfished. But I really wasn't in the mood for Avocado Toast again. I was imagining ceviche with a light miso wasabi dressing served over a bed of seasoned sushi rice and watercress (that's how I would have made an Asian inspired ceviche - just saying...). I looked closer at the item description and it mentioned cold celophane noodles. I thought that could work - I wasn't being picky.- The food comes out. There's four of us. Friends 1 & 2, ""It was okay"". Friend 3 ordered the meatballs. They're served in a clay tagine, I guess for presentation and effect. The waitress removed the lid in dramatic fashion. Inside were three or four meatballs comically small for the size of the tagine. At this point I'm feeling a little embarrassed for recommending this place.- My ceviche is served. At first I thought they got the order wrong. I though it was soup. I barely had a few bites before setting it aside. It was in fact the worst dish I've ever ordered. Anywhere.But if you want the recipe:1. Grab one clump of cold cellophane noodles and throw into a bowl.2. Grab one handful of ceviche chunks (any unsustainable fish variety will do); throw them in the bowl.3. Pour half a bottle of Kikkoman high sodium soy sauce over everything.4. Serve to your worst enemy. (After all, Revenge is a dish best served...)","70 Hudson Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"

2023-05-20,2023-09-16,Cafe Gitane,"Food was great but service was bad. Sat down and after nearly seven minutes I had to call a waitress over for water and to order. A carafe of water was just dropped on table and not even poured. Appetizer and meal came out at the same time. The waitress never checked in. For time of the check, the waitress never even showed me check and just swiped card. Very gen Z / lack of understanding of what service means.

My friends warned me about how good it was and it exceeded expectations. I'm not even sure what was in it, but I can say that the flavors and textures that each element brought to the dish were everything I wanted for lunch. The beautiful green olive oil underneath was super high quality and had to be scooped up with every bite. The little toasts were the perfect soakers for it. Careful with the harissa because that ish is shpiiiiicy, and a little goes a long way. I can't wait to visit New York again because of Cafe Gitane.","70 Hudson Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"

2022-04-23,2023-09-16,Cafe Gitane,"This place is very interesting... I fell in love with the interior and the overall vibes this place gives and everyone is either eating inside on a windy morning or sitting on the chairs outside when it's a warm sunny afternoon. I kept passing by this place and everyone always comes here and super excited to try this place as it gives an escape from the corporate feel that dumbo gives!Disclaimer: they serve la colombe and personally not a big fan of this company so I just did not order coffee. Instead had the Moroccan tea which was literally amazing and the highlight of my experience.I tried the baked eggs with tomato and my party had the salmon with ""pomegranate glaze""At first, this meal we had wasn't as satisfying as My standards for eggs are pretty high (jacks wife Freda for example is great) and I've never had baked eggs in my life and even though I asked for soft I guess it will never actually be real soft because it's been baked in an oven. I actually just rather get normal eggs with tomato instead. My party did not like the salmon at all since it was so bland and did not have any flavor and in particular not ""pomegranate glazed"" if anyone was wondering what it was about on the menu. I think the waitress/host got excited when I said baked and she said ""baked pasta?"" Because I think that's actually a good item on the menu. The baked eggs said ""baguette"" on the menu and I was hoping for a large piece of bread but I only got three thin little mediocre baguette slices. I really wish they put 3 little slices of bread instead of baguette on the menu so it could prep me for whatever I am about to receive.Every single table had the Moroccan Cous cous on it and a whole Korean family came in and ordered it for the entire table- French people were inside with plates of cous cous and at this point I felt bizarre I did not order this cous cous that everyone had. I had to come back.I came back and had some wine this time and the wine was a little funky- not gonna lie but we were promised ""somewhat sparkling"" rose but the rose was not sparkling at all. The Boudreaux was a pretty crazy tasting wine but was not bad and my cab sauv was ok. Maybe I should've stick to the Stella Artois or a melon martini (maybe next time because I watch them squeeze it fresh)I have tried the Moroccan cous cous and it was super good and I would recommend it since the flavors were amazing and this is the first time I actually like egg plant. I never order an eggplant dish but man this one tasted really good and I had no idea the eggplant was even there. The smoked trout salad was also much more satisfying as the flavors were a lot better than the salmon we received the last time.On final note, I don't know why I have such an obsession with this place. Is it the blue espresso machine? Is it because of vinegar hill? I don't know but I can't seem to stop trying their items. The staff was very nice and let me use the laptop here and even tried to look for outlets. The food isn't amazing besides for the cous cous so I don't really know what rating to really give it because I have had a unsatisfactory experience here with their other stuff. Maybe I'll go for the baked pasta and put an extra star. I would just say please just check it out yourself to figure out what to give it. It seems like there are some really amazing gems on the menu and some a complete waste of money.","70 Hudson Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201"

I heard it was the chef specifically on Tues and Thursday that does this sort of job.The steak was cooked to perfection. Juicy and perfectly pink in the middle, dripping with juice. The Mac and cheese is cooked in its own small pan with toasted crumbs on top. Creamy, delicate and decadent.I had the gnocchi, it was pan fried.. you would think it would be dense and overly filly but it was light and airy. The roasted garlic.

I wish I could give 5 stars and honestly, everything except the ribs gave me 5 star's experience, but the main course was a fail. Maybe it was a one time thing, and genuinely I hope the ribs usually taste different than what I've tried.P.S. I've heard that this place is much better for brunches!","171 Banker St Brooklyn, NY 11222"
2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Rule of Thirds,"Really okay food with a beautiful ambiance.Such a nice outdoor/indoor area to walk into -- the place is huge! It got me really excited for an ultimately expensive and disappointing meal. We got the duck hearts, lamb tongue, and sashimi. They were solid but not amazing. Where we went wrong was ordering the nikujaga. Again, it was okay, but for $40 I expected a lot more. The portion is pretty good, but the meat texture and the sauce felt... basic? Boring? Made me pretty sure I wouldn't come back to try anything else?","171 Banker St Brooklyn, NY 11222"
2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Rule of Thirds,"prob my favorite brunch in the city. gorgeous serene surrounds, absolutely divine fluffy souffle pancake, and the best tamago sando i've had. i genuinely crave this","171 Banker St Brooklyn, NY 11222"
2023-09-10,2023-09-16,Rule of Thirds,"Had a great date here with my wife. The outside dining area was a solid alternative to eating inside. I wish I recalled everything we tried, but I'd advise go the same route we did... order a bunch of different plates to share and expand your palate. We weren't disappointed and will certainly return.","171 Banker St Brooklyn, NY 11222"
2023-09-10,2023-09-16,Rule of Thirds,"Went on a hot Saturday day. The restaurant was very busy. They only had seats outside which was fine by me. They've got covering above us, but otherwise open with good air flow and plenty of fans.They served the brunch menu so we got Japanese breakfast, roasted buckwheat tea, Japanese potato salad and tekkadon.My wife loved the mackerel with the b Japanese breakfast. My favorite was the tekkadon: very cold, slim, slices of dark red tuna and the sauce made the rice. The potato salad was unusual as it was curried and not to our taste. Usually it's prepared differently. Loved the buckwheat tea! Caffeine free and smelled heavenly.If you've got dietary restrictions with dairy let them know: the bread, kaarage and Katsu have dairy.They've got a huge venue with indoor and outdoor seating, a Japanese liquor store and an event space for weddings and the like.Service was quite good, but she was crazy busy serving zillions of tables. They were so busy! Took a long time for us to get our order taken and the first dish to come out and then it went by like clockwork.If you use credit, they'll use a POS at your table just like Europe. Love it!My wife swears the lunch and dinner service is better menu wise. We will be back, but not for brunch.","171 Banker St Brooklyn, NY 11222"
2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Rule of Thirds,"Food, ambiance, cocktails...it was all a 10. This is an incredibly special place, the moment you walk in you'll be wowed by the design. We loved every bite of food, and didn't leave a crumb on any plate! A super unique menu and dining experience, I highly recommend!","171 Banker St Brooklyn, NY 11222"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Rule of Thirds,"TLDR: I really wanted to like Rule of Thirds. The space is beautiful and the concept is cool but for me, the space outshined the food. For the dishes I did like, the souffle pancake was good and the potato salad was great. Teishoku set was unique and enjoyable enough but a bit expensive IMO.When I first walked in, I had a really good feeling about this meal. The space is industrial but well-designed and very cool looking.We arrived a bit earlier for our seating but was told we'd have to wait. There was an empty table we saw but based on what we were told, we waited. Eventually they (same person spoke with first) checked back in with us and asked if we were waiting for the bar.We reminded them we had a reservation and then were offered the table that was available this whole time. We asked for something further back not quite looking to get sunburnt (it was crazy bright) and we finally sat.We ordered a lot. Got both sandos. The cold tamago sando was interesting but for me the fluffy white milk bread with this gold jiggly baton of almost jello-like egg just didn't do it for me. Even with the acidity of the green tomato. The chicken katsu sando was fine but nothing special. We also had not been given any water after our food started arriving but another server (not ours) eventually realized and then asked if we got any.Teishoku set. Probably the most ordered dish in the house. Grilled fish portion was kind of small and for it to be salmon, I'd probably have preferred something I don't make myself. The vegetables were good, the almond butter miso soup was unique but not sure if i prefer this to standard miso soup. Rice was tasty.Souffle pancake. Um, massive but probably one of the best things we had. Nice fluffy, not too sweet and the soft-serve on the side went along with it nicely.Potato salad. This was my favorite thing I had here. Although it was frustrating that this was the first thing I ordered and four tables who were seated afterwards - all got potato salads as the first dish served. As expected, this is chilled and pre-made so I would think this should come first. When I asked if it was still coming, I was told yes but I know - they definitely forgot to put it in. As far as the flavor, this was the most flavorful dish we had. A better than average Japanese potato salad but there was also curry powder in this which added an extra layer of umami. I have not seen this style before or since, the jammy egg was an added bonus.All in all. Would I come back? I'm not sure. The dinner dishes sound interesting enough but the mellow flavors and the sub-par service (for a place of this caliber) just kind of killed it for me.","171 Banker St Brooklyn, NY 11222"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Rule of Thirds,"Fairly average, but disappointing overall. It's a very large place, seats 150+ easy, and the high volume lower food quality shows. Drinks were off balance in flavor, poorly designed. Hot dishes felt prepared in advance, on the stale side. Fresh dishes were all odd flavor balanced on the sweet salty side, covering any good sashimi flavor. The place feels more of a club with louder music that serves food, cool to be seen, lots of dressed up people, the food and drinks missing the mark. Service was friendly and prompt. Just felt like a fancy cafeteria though.","171 Banker St Brooklyn, NY 11222"
2023-09-02,2023-09-16,Rule of Thirds,Fantastic Japanese breakfast spot in Brooklyn. It was easy to get a reservation for my group of 4 and the ambiance was beautiful and very typical Japanese/Scandinavian vibe. I got the traditional Japanese breakfast set and shared the pancake soufflé w/ their swirl of soft serve. We didn't try the cocktail but their teas and lattes are great non-alcoholic options. The service was fast and very good.,"171 Banker St Brooklyn, NY 11222"
2023-09-02,2023-09-16,Rule of Thirds,Each dish we had was wonderful. Especially loved the salad and sashimi. Cocktails were different and equally great! Definitely recommend.,"171 Banker St Brooklyn, NY 11222"
2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Sofreh,Excellent service and dining environment. Must have reservation. The staff were attentive and noted our dietary restrictions. The restaurant is modern and has fun/quirky Iranian I assume film in the bathroom. Food wise was very disappointing to me. The only nice item was the eggplant dip which also wasn't that memorable. The zucchini fritter was also just ok. The disappointment was the ash stew and cauliflower steak. Both were super sour and acidic like other reviews noted. We asked what was used which was Persian lime. They definitely went too generous on that. Our gum was very sensitive trying to finish those dishes and didn't enjoy. Food wise I prefer Shiraz Kitchen in Chelsea for unique Iranian food. The same dishes tasted better there.,"75 St Marks Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"

2023-08-09,2023-09-16,Sofreh,"The customer service was horrendous; I don't think I've ever seen a haughtier and more arrogant front staff.  Food was fine but not worth dressing with the attitude, which was essentially that I should be grateful to eat there.  They need desperately to have a more professional host than whoever the person currently is.  He neither looks nor talks the friendly part of a host and generally shocking he would be employed to do this job at a ""nice"" restaurant.  Be warned and book elsewhere.","75 St Marks Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-07-25,2023-09-16,Sofreh,A very nice experience here. The staff were friendly and the dishes were all quite good. The owner came over to us to make sure we were enjoying the food and even chefed up a free yogurt marmalade dish that she had been experimenting with. The prices here are typical of higher end persian restaurants so expect to spend some cash.,"75 St Marks Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-07-21,2023-09-16,Sofreh,"Fantastic ambiance, food was incredible!! We got a few starters to share and then the lamb to finish it off. Probably one of the best restaurants we've been to in a while! Recommend!","75 St Marks Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-07-16,2023-09-16,Sofreh,"The food was somewhat unusual, not bad, but I felt it was overpriced. While the outdoor garden seating was a cool, comfortable experience, it didn't make up for the small portions. As an aside, the waitress tried to guide our ordering as this was our first time there, but her guidance was off-the-mark. I don't want to destroy it completely, ergo the three stars, but I doubt we will be returning anytime soon.","75 St Marks Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-07-05,2023-09-16,Sofreh,"Persian restaurant with an impressive bar offering. My wife and I dined here on a weeknight. They were filled up inside but were able to seat us immediately outdoors.Great bar for a Persian restaurant. They had a tap takeover from Five Boroughs; gotta love a local tap takeover. Solid cocktail list too. I was feeling wine for the evening and was happy with their selection by the glass.For starters, we shared the eggplant and whey dip along with the tahini & date salad. Dip was very savory. Big caramelization flavors. Salad was pretty savory too with some nice textural contrasts. I paired this with a French rose. I was inkling for a natural wine but figured this would hit the spot.Between the courses, I had white wine from Piedmont.For the main course, we shared the lamb shank with the Orange zest & carrot rice. Big chunk of meat. Feel right off the bone. Believe it had a curry influenced sauce. Decided to pair this course with a red. Pretty bold on the reds with a Cote du Rhône, a Nebbiolo, a Bordeaux, and Chateau Musar. All budget friendly too at $16 or less for each. I opted for Musar for the Middle Eastern connection.For dessert, I had the saffron rice pudding.Service was polite and attentive. Drink orders were ready super quickly. The had a gender neutral restroom on the main floor which was handicap accessible. There was a second gender neutral restroom in their basement. The one on the basement had a projector playing something. Projector had USB, VGA, and AUX inputs in case you're curious.","75 St Marks Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-07-01,2023-09-16,Sofreh,"Overall rating: 4.9I love, love, love this place. Best to go with a friend so you can split items! That said, I loved it so much, I def want to try a walk-in at the bar when I'm ready to spend money.  I realized a little too late that I didn't take many pictures. But here's what I had:- grilled carrots & yogurt: 5/5 so good!- feta & herbs flatbread: 4/5 good! But nothing special.- tahini & date salad: 5/5 mouthwatering & I still think about it.- orange zest & carrot rice: 5/5 obsessed- half chicken 5/5 so filling!We also had cocktails but I can't remember their names. The waiter was also the absolute sweetest. We weren't sure which rice to get, but he made a suggestion based on what we ordered. It felt very thoughtful & genuine.I have to disclose this was my first time eating Persian food, so I could be biased. But I definitely want to come back & try more!I knocked off .1 because, oh man, they really try to squish you in. I would have preferred maybe 5 or 10 more inches of space. But it is what it is.Highly recommend!","75 St Marks Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"

2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Sushi Lab Rooftop,"The setting for this restaurant is a flavor all in itself: beautiful, open, inviting and serene. Then you order the food and it's a mouth watering experience. We opted for their dynamic rolls and they did not disappoint. Our favorites were the eel, yellowtail and matcha crunch! Next time we will plan on the time and appetite for an Omakase experience. Try the cold house sake and make sure it's brrrr.  Overall: Totally worth it!!","132 W 47th St New York, NY 10036"
2023-08-24,2023-09-16,Sushi Lab Rooftop,"It's true what others say, sushi lab rooftop is just a pretty ambience restaurant. From the moment I received the you will only get 90 minutes to dine- that was already a foreshadowing of what's to come. I came here yesterday for my birthday. They don't take note of any celebrations, so don't anticipate any nice gestures. It's super loud with music and chatter...this I didn't expect because the photos do give a romantic vibe. You have been warned! The dinner felt rushed. When the waiters bring you the sushi- they explain each piece in 1 second and then walk away as quickly as they can to move on to the next. It felt all too factory for me. The fish was mediocre at best. There is better out there! I thought the price was fair for the 15 pieces that you get. Beautiful space, but I wouldn't return and I wouldn't recommend to others who ask.","132 W 47th St New York, NY 10036"

2023-08-17,2023-09-16,Sushi Lab Rooftop,"Loving Sushi Lab. I got to go this weekend when my elderly aunties took us out to the city for show & lunch. Firstly the doormen of the Sanctuary Hotel were lovely. So respectful. Aided my elderly aunt who uses a cane up the front stoop (stairs). The front desk receptionist was lovely and gave us access to a extra floor not to have my aunt walk extra. The décor of the sanctuary hotel is very young and full of mystique and it scared my aunts but I told them to trust me. It was nice to see all the families and young influencers use the hotel. As we go up we are met with the light vibrant ambiance of the rooftop. Its a nice switch to the senses. Their was only one server on duty and the lunch crowd was giving her a run for her money. Everything was perfectly balanced. The sushi needs no extra flavor or sauce. There were four of us. We had Crab Tacos, Sushiw/pear, avocado fries, Tuna crispy rice, the pasta dish, handrolls, several of their maki rolls. One was the green tea crunch and yellow tail and I think the wagyushugu. We ordered a bit of their lab specials . I can say it was a lovely day. For dessert we had the matcha creme brulee. It was a lovely time. Only downside the wait staff was very busy and just forgot one drink order but I get it she was swamped. So none the worse for wear. On our way out My aunts phone was low and the hotel lobby worker offered us to sit and charge it. We stayed about 11 more minutes and then went on our way. Thank sushi lab and to the sanctuary hotel for letting us older people cramp your style for a while.","132 W 47th St New York, NY 10036"
2023-08-06,2023-09-16,Sushi Lab Rooftop,"This place was amazing!!! My friends and I came here after work for some dinner/drinks. The rooftop is very cute and the hallways to get there feel fancy/exclusive. Their menu items and drinks are very unique.We ended up doing family style because there were so many items we wanted to try. We got the Bluefin Toro Tartare, Tuna Lover Roll, Matcha Crunch Roll, Washugyu Beef Roll and a classic salmon roll (not on menu, we just requested it). We loved everything!! My favorite was the Tuna Lover Roll (loved the jalapeno kick), but the wagyu was also very unique and nicely flavored.For my drink, I got the Tokyo Mule which was very yujmy but apparently the Strawberry Geisha is one of their most popular items.Overall, great experience here!","132 W 47th St New York, NY 10036"

2023-07-31,2023-09-16,Sushi Lab Rooftop,"Service was great (including the hotel doorman and the check-in downstairs), the journey upstairs is really fun, and the food is prepared expertly, if a bit too salty.

2023-07-30,2023-09-16,Sushi Lab Rooftop,"Put simple, Sushi Lab is fantastic. The Rooftop experience is a great getaway from some of the craziness of the city while still providing a great trendy feel. We ordered The Lab Experiment fifteen-piece omakase experience and some sake and were not disappointed.We sat at the chef counter, and our bites  included softshell crab, otoro with caviar, golden snapper with jalapeno ceviche, and A5 wagyu on top of fried rice just to name a few.The price is remarkably affordable for what you get, and while this is not your place if you're looking for something stuffy and buttoned up, it is your place for a fun date night before drinks or a visit to the theatre nearby. The service was solid as well, especially given that there were no open seats by the time our food started arriving. This place is defintely worth a stop.","132 W 47th St New York, NY 10036"

However, something about the sun and sitting on the top deck (with a resy) had me feeling a little queasy. Once we got our order in and ate I felt much better but I don't know that I would want to eat on the top deck again. The waiter was very friendly and kind when offering recommendations. I ordered the lobster roll with fries which was very fresh and did not disappoint. A pretty penny though- just know you're paying for the experience on top of the food! I would come to show some friends or family in town but I don't think i'd come back here for a regular meal as a New York resident.bc it was so crowded, we had a hard time getting the waiters attention for the check or asking for more water.

The food was really good & I will definitely come back to try the lunch menu next. The only downfall is that you may get motion sickness since the restaurant floats on the Hudson River. You're likely to feel like light rocking, but it's manageable. You have to order your food at the bar area and the line can get pretty long, so it's best to come early.","207 12th Ave Big Red Boat in Park New York, NY 10001"

After ordering and paying, you're handed a buzzer.We ordered the fish tacos, seafood bake and a lobster BLT. The lobster BLT had huge chunks of lobster and each bite was the perfect bite. Should probably eat this asap before the bread gets too soggy. The fish tacos were a tad bit disappointing.

2023-08-26,2023-09-16,Balzem,"Came here with a group for brunch. There was no one else in the restaurant which may be foreshadowing a bit. Anyway, I got the steak and eggs and they were horrible. First off, they didn't even ask how I wanted my steak cooked or my eggs cooked. I had to catch the waitress afterward to tell her about the steak temp (I asked for medium rare). Well the steak came back mostly medium well, with some pieces medium (was not evenly cooked). The presentation was horrendous (look at my photo to see how it arrived). It was super oily as well.The service also was questionable. The staff were just casually sitting at high tops by our table the entire time which felt awkward because they had nothing else to do except for lurking behind us.The only reason why I give 3 stars (rounding up) is because everyone else's food looked decent, but I would not recommend.","202 Mott St New York, NY 10012"
2023-08-22,2023-09-16,Balzem,"We had a lovely outing with my girlfriend today. We decided to try some unique dishes like the Spicy Feta Cheese Dip and Beet Salad. However, the flavors were a bit surprising. The paprika in the dip was overpowering, overshadowing the taste of the feta cheese. As for the Beet Salad, the quality of the avocado was not up to par. It tasted like a young avocado, which was too strong for our liking. The portions were also quite small for both the salad and the dip. For our main course, we opted for the Brochette Platter, which was interesting in its concept, but it came with no sides, such as rice or salad. Overall, the dinner cost us $200.82, including a tip of $19. We may need some more time before considering a return visit.","202 Mott St New York, NY 10012"

2023-08-26,2023-09-16,Sofun Noodle Bar,"Located in a newish redevelopment in LIC amongst a number of other new spots and a brewery, I liked the area right away. Inside is cute with small tables and a bar (not yet serving alcohol yet). We sat at the bar and ordered the signature noodles and the beef brisket noodle soup, along with the soup dumplings and popcorn chicken apps. Noodle dishes were great and unique, both having a slight tangy taste to them. Dumplings were solid, but the popcorn chicken was below average with too tiny pieces (esp for $11). Entree menu is limited to 2 dry noodles and about 6 noodle soups, so make sure you're in the mood for that before coming. I had a good time and would return!","4340 12th St Queens, NY 11101"
2023-08-18,2023-09-16,Sofun Noodle Bar,"I went here yesterday with 3 friends! Came here on a spontaneous Thursday night. We heard about this place through social media and decided to give it a try!This restaurant is fairly new (opened late June), it's well decorated with plants. The place is not too big, can maybe fit a few tables, but which is fine for when we went. I would imagine on busier nights it'll be tougher to dine in.We got the century egg salad to start. It was definitely very tasty with a spicy kick to it.Amongst the four of us, we got the signature Lu fen noodles, beef brisket noodles, and the tofu with meat sauce noodles.We all thought it was very tasty and we left full! We thought it was a very decent spot to grab quick noods on a whim.","4340 12th St Queens, NY 11101"
2023-08-12,2023-09-16,Sofun Noodle Bar,"Aesthetic - really chic and cute decor and plating. They even have real plants lined up on the wall behind the booths! I also love the small dishes they provide for apps!There are not too many tables, which was not an issue since there were only a total of 3 parties including my friend and I during the ~1.5 hours we were dining there. That was something off about the ambiance; there was only the server and the chef prepping food in the kitchen (2 people), and felt almost too quiet and empty. For context, it was a Thursday evening.I did see there were many takeout orders being prepared, so I wonder if they are leaning towards being a takeout place more than a dining out spot.The food itself was okay. It was $20 for the bowls of noodles. I ordered the beef brisket noodle soup. It had an interesting blend of ingredients. Because of the lime, it had a more tangy/sour taste, which I personally wasn't the biggest fan of. My friend got the Signature Lu Fen, which she enjoyed. We had also ordered, the same time as we put in the order for the noodle dishes, an order of sticky rice. This was under the dim sum section. Overall it was good, but I believe there was just 1piece of chicken, 1 piece of sausage, 1 egg yolk in the sticky rice. It's fun to share but just be prepared for the different proteins hidden inside.The timing of serving the dim sum dish was weird. My friend and I had finished our noodles and had been talking for several minutes more until the sticky rice came out. I was expecting either it would have been served like an appetizer or during the time we were eating the noodles. It worked out okay because even after eating the noodles we weren't full yet, but again, the timing the small dish came to the table was odd.","4340 12th St Queens, NY 11101"
2023-08-06,2023-09-16,Sofun Noodle Bar,"Small restaurant quite off the beaten path; came for dinner (so not the instagram dim sum meal). We got 2 mains and a popcorn chicken - i preferred the beef brisket because i enjoyed the slightly sour broth. The spicy ribs noodle are not spicy at all so no need to fear and the popcorn chicken was alright, nothing to write home about.Overall the portions were quite small, and combined with the pricetags...the journey one must make to come here becomes a bit questioned. The ingredients did seem quite fresh and quality so it may be worthwhile if you're in the area and pressed for time and have a few bucks to spare.","4340 12th St Queens, NY 11101"
2023-08-03,2023-09-16,Sofun Noodle Bar,"Pretty good! We got their signature noodles (the best), beef brisket noodles (just ok), popcorn chicken (yummy but over salted), and cucumber salad (super good).However it was really frustrating because most of the things we originally picked from the menu were out. Mind you we came at like 5:30pm on a weekday so it wasnt super busy or anything. Almost all these dishes were our second choices... not sure what is going on there.","4340 12th St Queens, NY 11101"

The food here was a sweet surprise and I enjoyed every bite of my meal.I ordered the signature noodle dish and durian puff (the ones you typically see at dim sum places). The signature noodle dish wasn't too oily, too salty, too hefty - it was just right as Goldilocks once said. The noodle had the perfect bounce which I really enjoyed. The durian puff was piping hot and not drenched in oil. Now I know where to get my durian fix without going to Chinatown or Sunset Park.","4340 12th St Queens, NY 11101"

It is very open and a great view of Houston Street.  Surprisingly, despite all the noise outside, it is pretty quiet inside.I was happy to see that they have a small bar/ counter area. I was also happy to see draft beer! I was even happier to see they have a fried chicken sandwich with a beer for only twenty bucks!The fries were OK. But the chicken sandwich on the freshly baked sourdough bread was fabulous! My friend enjoyed her pancakes, they came with a sauce.

Not sure if the best in the city but very good+ We paired pancakes with eggs benny ($18) and that was good. Our waiter recommended the spanish scramble for next visit+ We got so lucky with a walk-in. We were quoted a 2.5 hour wait for two people on Labor Day but waited outside for 10min or so, and got seated shortly after at the barMy best advice for this place is to 1) get a resy in advance if you can, and 2) ensure you put your name on waitlist for both the dining room and the bar. I'd maybe even add in 3) dine solo and get seated much faster at the bar.","4 Clinton St New York, NY 10002"

The blueberry compote paired with the warm maple butter took these pancakes to the next level.The service was fast and the employees were attentive and welcoming.Overall, it was a great experience.

I also tried the eggs Benedict, they were alright as well. I tried their fried chicken and it was just not good. The chicken had this really weird taste to it, and it was basically inedible. I also tried their burger and fries: the burger was meh (extremely dry) and the fries were over cooked. The service was very good though.","4 Clinton St New York, NY 10002"
2023-09-01,2023-09-16,Clinton Street Baking Company,"Clinton Street is one of my all-time favorite restaurants in New York City. Each time I visit, the food never disappoints, and the service is attentive and efficient. It definitely stays packed so it's really hard to say when's the best time to visit. I will say, if possible, have a reservation because it will make your life much easier, but they do take walk-ins.You have to try their pancakes, if that's your thing. I love them so much, and each flavor I've tried had been delicious, but don't sleep on their waffles either because they are just as good. Now what really surprised me was their fried chicken sandwich, the chicken is cooked to perfection, and the bread complements it so well, without being too hard or too soft. I definitely want to try more of their lunch/dinner menu items because they offer those too.The overall atmosphere of this location is pretty casual, but quite high energy because of how fast pace everything is. If that's not up your speed, they also have a counter located inside the Time out market in Dumbo Brooklyn. They might not have all of the menu items like the lower Eastside location, but they still have their most iconic dishes. Regardless, I always recommend checking this gem out because it's so good!","4 Clinton St New York, NY 10002"
2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Clinton Street Baking Company,"After hearing so much hype around Clinton St Bakery, I finally made it a point to try out their brunch this week. We made reservations to avoid the long lines and we were escorted to our seats promptly after arrival.We ordered an iced oat milk latte, freshly squeezed orange juice, wild Maine blueberry pancakes, classic eggs Benedict and a side of their sugar cured bacon. The blueberries in the pancakes were slightly tart and it balanced out the fluffy pancakes and sweet maple butter perfectly. Eggs Benedict were pretty standard, nothing overly special. The sugar cured bacon was a delicious combination of savory and sweet. The only thing that we didn't like was our iced oat milk latte. We're usually not too picky with our coffee but the latte was undrinkable. There was a small layer of oil on top which I suspect is from the oat milk and it also tasted like bitter, watered down coffee.I'd come back again for the pancakes and bacon but would avoid the iced latte the next time I dine here.","4 Clinton St New York, NY 10002"

Great flavor, although I would've preferred ground chorizo, not like sausage slices.

The ambiance gives the essence of a tavern with the rustic decor, rudimentary lighting, and shades of tan apparel but feels much like a commercialized quasi-tavern built for Disney World verses the aged home grown feel of a true English tavern. The service was spectacular and the delivery of the food perfectly timed. Several of the dishes were bursting with micro flavors while one of the meat dishes left more to be desired. Overall, I would recommend but certainly not my favorite.","42 E 20th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-05,2023-09-16,Gramercy Tavern,Excellent food.  Great services.  Good wine. Great atmosphere.   Their Bordeaux is one of the best I ever had.,"42 E 20th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-04,2023-09-16,Gramercy Tavern,"Lovely food and amazing service. Yes the prices are extremely high, but the food is great quality. Minus 1 star for the sheer amount of salt they added to the food. The cucumber soup I had to send back because the salt level made me gag. The bread was over salted too, and even my chicken was salty and the skin had fat on it and was soggy.","42 E 20th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Gramercy Tavern,"I absolutely love Gramercy Tavern and come whenever I am in NYC, by far my favorite ""foodie""Restaurant!!Our server, Amanda, was so helpful with suggestions on food and wine, she is the ultimate professional and top notch customer service, just felt she made our dinner the Best Experience Ever!! We were celebrating my daughter's birthday and her official move to her first apartment in NYC and Amanda made sure our night was perfect!!We had the cucumber soup, hard to describe how amazing a chilled soup could be- you MUST order it!! Then we had beef tartare-quite spectacular! Then  mains were sea bass and cavatelli, both excellent!!Each item was beautifully plated, with layers of flavors that just all melded into an absolute pleasure on the palate. The ingredients felt Like they were fresh picked from a garden a minute before preparing, everything just bursting with flavor!!Thank you Amanda for giving us an amazing evening and as always, we will return!!!!Of note, we Loved the friendly kind professional Hostess and in the past had a fabulous bartender that was top notch- saw him working last night but not sure of his name- a great mixologist who has been there for many years and is excellent at his craft!","42 E 20th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-09-01,2023-09-16,Gramercy Tavern,"Food, service, and ambiance deserve only an average rating at best.   My first time in NY.  Price is high for the food!   Not worth coming to..My room service from DoorDash is more worthwhile.   I won't recommend or coming here again.","42 E 20th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Gramercy Tavern,"Great ambiance! I booked 30 days in advance to get a prime dinner time for a small group for my friend's birthday. We had a fabulous time here, drinking bubbles throughout. Note that they take the bottle away between pours, something that my friend was not a fan of, but were very attentive and made sure our glasses were never empty. We shared the flatbread and dips to start  and I had the famous tavern burger. While it was a delicious, high quality burger and very good, I actually don't rank it as one of the best in the city. To be honest I wasn't blown away by the food here in general (don't get me wrong, it was very good, but perhaps my expectations were just too high) but I did love the ambiance and vibe.","42 E 20th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-19,2023-09-16,The Woo,Excellent all around; I personally didn't try to order off menu items yet; but this kind of place strikes me as those that will do their best to satisfy whatever you crave as long as they have all the ingredients needed to make a dish that suits your palate!,"206 Spring St New York, NY 10012"
2022-04-09,2023-09-16,The Woo,"Alex was our bartender but helped Humberto (our waiter) bring & take our delicious food away so we can share leftovers home (we always order way too much). The vibe here is totally positive & a great place to hang. You never feel there's a rush to decide what to order; or please finish your food, so they can seat other patrons! Needless to say, we'll be back with other friends as soon as possible & as often as possible. It's just too bad so many other places nearby recently do not open until after 4-5pm. What do you do if you want late lunch or early dinner!? Come here to Woo; you won't regret it!!","206 Spring St New York, NY 10012"
2023-08-18,2023-09-16,The Woo,"I had went here for my birthday back in 2022, I had wanted to try Korean BBQ, boy was I wrong!! I should've never tried something new off the restaurant week menu. I didn't like the food and I didn't intend to cook my own food, the waiter turned on the fire for me. The service was great, I had to ask for ice water and not just water. This place had an unsanitary bathroom and that's all I'm going to say on the subject. We we're sharing one bathroom upstairs with everyone, the customers and the employees, this bathroom needs to be service ever hour on the hour. I love this martini!!! If they had alcohol on the go, I will be the first in line to get the Lychee Martini!!!! I give it two stars only for the Martini.","206 Spring St New York, NY 10012"
2023-08-12,2023-09-16,The Woo,"It was ok. I didn't know it was restaurant week so I tried the special. it came with an appetizer (we got wings and pork belly bun), jap chae, and we opted for meat which was extra. the meat was ok. the atmosphere was alright. the waiter was nice but the entire place wasn't what i expected.","206 Spring St New York, NY 10012"
2023-07-29,2023-09-16,The Woo,"This place is Ridiculously Hot. NO working air conditioning. They have a make shift a/c upstairs. Downstairs is a fan blowing heat and dirt onto the food. This place does not even cook your food/bbq. They were offended when I asked if someone would come and grill the meat. Waiter left the meat and left. We had a large party and autotiped 20% which was a joke for the terrible service. Mediocre food and hot hot hot unbearable eating environment. Here is the kicker. Being so hot, people moved the air blowers and made us and the kids even hotter. Probably better to go straight to ktown for better food and ac at more reasonable prices.","206 Spring St New York, NY 10012"
2023-07-20,2023-09-16,The Woo,Food was yummy!  You have the choice of cooking it yourself or have them precook it for you.  Since it was so hot we had them cook it for us.  The food was good portion and was all yummy!   Drinks are delicious as well.  This place is good for big group gathering.,"206 Spring St New York, NY 10012"
2023-06-12,2023-09-16,The Woo,"Mostly, I rate on the quality of the food. The only time that I will ding a restaurant on service is if the price tag justifies it or if the service was truly terrible. The Woo charges $40 dollars for a serving of bulgogi, which would run you about 25-30 dollars at any other spot. Therefore, I'm bringing service into the equation.Food quality - 4The food here is good. We had the ddukbboki, bulgogi, spicy bulgogi, cow tongue, brisket and pork belly. The quality of the meat was very good, but I would rate it on the same level as the quality you'd experience at Don's Bogam. The rice cakes in the ddukbboki also tasted freshly made.Service - 2It was hard to get a grill change. We asked multiple times and couldn't get any service.Prices - 2This places was really expensive in comparison to a lot of the other KBBQ places in the city.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're trying to be fancy for no reason.","206 Spring St New York, NY 10012"
2023-05-29,2023-09-16,The Woo,"We had a large party of 16 and for the most part enjoyed our dinner here. You pay for the service and ambiance in addition to the food. The food is good but certain dishes we've had better elsewhere. Regardless, it's a great place to check out and enjoy a nice dinner.","206 Spring St New York, NY 10012"
2023-05-07,2023-09-16,The Woo,"The service and restaurant interior was nice, but the food was not that great. The food is more closer to Korean fusion, so be careful and don't expect authentic Korean food.1) Beef Tatare or Yookhwe - this was still frozen when brought to the table, but the flavor was nice. We couldn't really mix it up because of how icy the dish was2) Tteokbokki - savory, but did not taste like tteokbokki at all and strangely had zucchini in it. The sauce was not the normal tteokbokki sauce and the rice cakes are cut smaller.3) Korean fried chicken - probably the best dish. The chicken was crispy and very saucy. However the bottom pieces that have been in the sauce for a while were salty.4) Also had bibimbap and yookgaejang - both were just okay, I wouldn't recommend ordering","206 Spring St New York, NY 10012"
2023-05-05,2023-09-16,The Woo,"For the price, I was disappointed with the food. I picked up my order of kimchi stew and kimchi stir fry, which are both simple, homey dishes, but both had upfront issues.The Kimchi stew was soo sandy, I have no idea what it could be, but it felt like I was chewing through grains. The taste otherwise was good, but it also contained so few tofu and meat pieces, I'd say maybe 4/5 pieces in the entire soup container.The stir fry was also tasty but WAY too salty, even for someone who loves dishes on the saltier side.Overall I could have spent $10-15 fewer ordering from Hanok but thought I'd splurge on higher quality, but seems this was not the case here.Ambiance inside looks nice though, so could be more of a vibes than food type of place.","206 Spring St New York, NY 10012"
2019-09-04,2023-09-16,The Woo,"5 stars for both dining in and delivery.The food is just absolutely delicious. I love dishes where there is the star ingredient but there are also many other vegetables, garnishes, toppings included as well and The Woo does that.I have had their kimchi jjigae, duck BBQ, seafood stew, and japchae and they are all solid dishes. Even though these are the most common choices at a korean restaurant, The Woo has me going back just to theirs because there's just something about these dishes' tastes that far surpasses the rest.It is fairly pricey but very worth it!","206 Spring St New York, NY 10012"
2023-04-29,2023-09-16,The Woo,"Terrible, Terrible ExperienceSpoiled out birthday celebration, slow inattentive service and we were treated extremely disrespectfully. Average KBBQ at extremely high prices. You are better off going to a multitude of wonderful restaurants in the area. I frankly feel embarrassed to have brought my guests here.","206 Spring St New York, NY 10012"
2023-09-08,2023-09-16,Bacall's,"We felt like this place was an overpriced tourist trap, and the only highlight was the majority of the staff were professional. Our original waiter seemed to really hate his job though. I ordered the blue dream cocktail and it was extremely sour, not even a hint of sweetness and I couldn't even drink it. We tried to be nice about it, but our original waiter just argued that it's ""supposed to be sour"" and didn't offer any remedy. He was also extremely judgmental about how my friend wanted his steak cooked because my friend wanted his steak well-done, so the waiter told my friend he must like his meat ""dry and tough"".  The irony is that he served my husband's steak bright red rare with a sight sear on the outside (when he ordered it medium rare). At some point, our original waiter was replaced and his replacement was so much nicer (hence 2 stars instead of 1).  The cocktail was taken off our bill. Overall, the food was mediocre at best and the cherry on top was probably the weirdly sweet peppercorn sauce that was served with the steak. There is nothing I would recommend here and will never return.","220 West 44th St New York, NY 10036"
2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Bacall's,"We had 8pm tickets to see A Beautiful Noise in NYC . Bacall's was literally across the street from the theater. Seated promptly at 5:30. Received free Prosecco for Yelp checkin.  Ordered $45 3 course prix fixe. Chose caesar salad which had tasty dressing. Half chicken fried chicken entree was crisp and moist, though slightly salty. Side of good thin fries. Dessert was crisp, hot churros. My wife had bean burger that she enjoyed. Service was excellent! Abi and his couldn't have been better.  Easily recommend, especially pre Broadway show","220 West 44th St New York, NY 10036"

My friends liked their salads and drinks. The only con was that we told the waitress when we sat that we were in a rush to get to the show and placed our order immediately. But the food took forever! And the place was not busy. No one even came to say anything. We went to them, then finally they checked and said a manager was checking... it came out a little while later. What bothered me was the other girl that came over acted like we didn't tell them from the start we were in a rush when we made it a point to!","220 West 44th St New York, NY 10036"

Service was excellent, food was very good, and the space was appealing. I asked about the lobster-stuffed trout that was semi-off-menu (listed outside and on the delivery menu, but not on the physical menu) and got it! I was good. I was also pleased that they offered me an off-menu side dish version of the Caesar Salad when I asked. I might just go there on a future trip!","220 West 44th St New York, NY 10036"

It was delicious!!If you're looking for a nice restaurant to go to before or after hitting a play, go check them out. I don't think you'll be disappointed.","220 West 44th St New York, NY 10036"
2023-07-11,2023-09-16,Bacall's,"I just left this place terribly upset. First and last time there for me. My boss picked this place because she said it had great reviews. We had a reserved table for 6. I ordered an Espresso Martini, it came 11 minutes after my co workers had finished their cocktails. The waiter apologized for the delay. The martini rated 3/10. It didn't have any froth on it, very bland and tasteless. I have had much better Espresso martinis. I wish that was the worst of it. I ordered the arugula salad dressed with fig, Burrata and prosciutto plus a side of salmon. My ""SALAD"" came 19 minutes after my table mates received their meals. Outside of being totally pissed that both my drink order and my meal (a damn salad y'all) were both unacceptably delayed, the piece of salmon was so over cooked and dry. I couldn't even eat it. Realistically speaking , how long does it take to construct a salad? Needless to say, I didn't order dessert, who knows what time of the night I would have received that. Obviously that's my first and last time there.  BTW the place was far from crowded so I have absolutely no idea why both of my orders did not come along with everyone else's. Truly disappointing and embarrassing to to point that my table guests felt guilty eating while I watched them.","220 West 44th St New York, NY 10036"

2023-09-09,2023-09-16,Reyna,"I'm not sure what to rave about first-the decor, the drinks, or the food. I'll start with the decor since that's the first thing I experienced when I walked in the door. Every design element is so clearly thought out to create a sexy, but laid back, vibe. The feathered chandeliers above the bar are the centerpiece-one of a kind. For drinks I ordered the pornstar martini. I loved the passion fruit caviar served with it. So refreshing. I wanted more and basically ordered a 2nd drink just for that. For food I ordered the crispy artichokes, the croquettes, and the lamb baklava. The artichokes, even though they are fried, were so lemony and light. The  croquettes just melted in my mouth and had just a drizzle of sauce that balanced out the cheese. I was talked into ordering the baklava. I don't like the dessert version of baklava, so I was hesitant, but this lamb version was nothing like it. It looked like a birds nest-shredded strips of dough wrapped around wonderfully marinated lamb. If you are a vegetarian (like me) this dish is worth it. Lastly, thumbs up to the bartender and the hostess who were both attentive and actually thanked me on the way out!","11 E 13th St New York, NY 10003"

There were only a few people at the restaurant. We have to ask the waitress to open the AC for us because we are all sweating... My friends ordered a rose and a lemonade. The lemonade was nothing but tap water with a piece of lemon. No taste at all. We ordered the same thing again thinking the waitress might've gotten us the wrong drink. We also asked what's inside the lemonade, the waitress said it's water with lemon and some syrup... at least she is being honest about it. Do not try:( So both of the appetizers we ordered are pretty good ( tartare and egg white bacon toast). There come the main courses which are the duck and mussels with white wine sauce and it was recommended on the daily special board. The duck was very good, soft, and juicy, but when the mussels came, we all smelled something weird, and thinking was probably the fishy smells of the seafood then when we were eating them, a lot of the mussels were spoiled, and gone bad. I mean if we can smell something wrong, the chef should've known and shouldn't be serving it to the customers. We didn't take a pic of the mussels because it didn't look good anyways. It was not a good experience, to be honest.","177 Henry St New York, NY 10002"

Walked in before my boyfriend and was ignored for a few minutes before someone sitting at the bar turned around and said ""are you waiting for a table?"" ""I have a reservation"" ""oh... you can wait at the bar"".Got seated fine, order was taken. Appetizer came out quick and was warm and delicious. Mains came out shortly after and while delicious, was mostly cold. During the main course I asked for a glass of wine and never got it. While we were finishing our mains, a HUGE group came in and got seated. We basically were ignored from that moment on. I feel bad for the one waitress that was handling the whole dining room, but the bartender and host (aka man sitting at the bar who ignored me) did nothing to help.Finally got our waitress's attention for the check (dirty dishes still in front of us).

2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Douska,"Amazing food and great price! It was like a less expensive omakase spot and we came out really full because of all the handrolls. It was a good experience being able to DIY our handrolls as well, similar feel to Ume in Brooklyn.","63 Delancey St New York, NY 10002"

2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Douska,"Passed this place all the time, it looks unassuming from the outside. Never expected a nice hand roll/sushi spot inside!Overall great experience! Comparable to other handroll places in the city. Got seated quickly and the handrolls kept coming. I'd come back again!","63 Delancey St New York, NY 10002"
2023-08-27,2023-09-16,Douska,"A year and a half ago, I was obsessed with this place, came multiple times a week and recommended it to everyone I knew.  I went recently and it was shocking how far it has fallen in quality.  From an easy 5 stars to 2.5 at best so I'm rounding up for the good memories. A real bummer.","63 Delancey St New York, NY 10002"

Great relaxed vibe - they even have a little zen garden in the restroom lolThe food was decentTemaki Platter is very aesthetically appealing. Comes on an adorable platter with Assorted sashimi, bowl of rice, nori seaweed sheets, and bowl of miso soup. Self assembling sushi hand rolls are fun. They even gave you a brush to brush the soy sauce","63 Delancey St New York, NY 10002"
2023-08-11,2023-09-16,Douska,"I really enjoyed the Douska hand roll set, especially the spicy scallop and hamachi rolls. They torch their tamago nigiri and add some sauce which I haven't seen before but is an excellent way to make tamago special","63 Delancey St New York, NY 10002"
2023-07-14,2023-09-16,Douska,Had the temaki platter and it was super fun to make your own temaki. Fish was fresh and delicious!!,"63 Delancey St New York, NY 10002"
2023-06-24,2023-09-16,Douska,"Nice place for some well priced sushi! I ordered a spicy tuna sushi roll and a cucumber avocado hand roll. I'm not an expert on sushi but if you're in the mood for something simple, not expensive, and pretty casual then I  would recommend this place. The restaurant itself is cute and has indoor and patio seating. On a Friday night  my friend and I were able to gett a table just walking in. Solid staple for sushi in the LES area, I'll  be back for sure!","63 Delancey St New York, NY 10002"

It's sooooo hot outside! $5 bucks for anything cold is a welcomed treat. The restaurant looks really nice. The ice cream machine is outside, I ask the waiter to hook a brother up with some of that dessert we all scream for.The cup? It was the size of a small cup you get at the dentist. A Dixie Cup can kick its ass. Honey on the bottom, soft serve vanilla and sea salt sprinkled on top.Was it good? Hell yes","103 Havemeyer St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

The outdoor shed does have air conditioning, a MAJOR PLUS!!!  The decor is very neighborhood french bistro.The service was great & attentive, even on a busy Saturday brunch.We ordered the burger, which was seasoned to perfection. The Nutella French toast for a sweet fix & the eggs/meat breakfast... all were a hit!!","103 Havemeyer St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-07-05,2023-09-16,Recette,"Absolutely loved my meal at Recette! We had all my favorite French classics (Escargot, Steak Frites, Creme Brulee) and I was impressed with all three. We also tried the octopus from the appetizer list which may have been my favorite thing from the whole meal. The team was so friendly from the second we entered the door, and the vibes were perfect (I loved all the floral elements). Both the patio and inside were decently full but not too jam-packed to the point where I felt uncomfortable. Will definitely be going back to try their brunch at some point in the future - I need to try that Croque Madame!","103 Havemeyer St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Industry Kitchen,Just had the most amazing late summer lunch. Every recommendation from Monica (not to mention healthy drinks) was spot on. Great views of the river and the vibe is just perfectly relaxing.,"70 South St New York, NY 10005"
2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Industry Kitchen,"This was our second time here and we had delicious food & excellent service both times. (Ask for Ryan!) For appetizers we shared the short rib bao buns, lamb lollipops, tuna nachos, steamed mussels, & burrata which were all WONDERFUL.The Caesar salad with added grilled chicken was very flavorful & don't skip the Honeybee pizza- It's a perfect blend of sweet & spicy.The cocktail menu is very trendy & fun, go for the Purple Butterfly if you want something refreshing that's also pretty!We've eaten both indoors or outside overlooking the water and you can't go wrong either way. Industry Kitchen is a must visit in the area if you're looking for great food with a fun vibe.","70 South St New York, NY 10005"
2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Industry Kitchen,"3.5 starsMy colleagues and I were looking for a place to grab lunch before a summertime work meeting downtown.  I had been curious about Industry Kitchen and knew it offered stellar views, so I selected it as our destination.  It was rather humid that day, so we skipped the patio dining and grabbed a table inside, which still offered a nice view of the East River and Brooklyn.We started by sharing a few appetizers.  The Grilled Lamb Lollipops were a bit fatty, but were well-cooked and uniquely crusted with goat cheese and pistachios.  The chops were topped with a sweet fig jam that paired perfectly with the funk of the goat cheese.  There was also some mache lettuce included as a garnish.  The Duo of Dips included a sundried tomato hummus and a basil ricotta, both of which were very flavorful.  However, the included ""soft pita"" was rather dry and bland.After those bites, we each selected our own main dishes.  I went with the seasonal Watermelon & Feta Salad, which included huge chunks of melon, cheese crumbles, baby arugula, fresh basil, and pickled red onion.  I added Grilled Jumbo Shrimp, which were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I loved that the menu specified that my addition would include 4 shrimp; they also had noted that if you added grilled chicken, it would be 8-ounces worth.  There is nothing worse than paying for an extra topping and feeling like the restaurant was stingy about what it provided for the cost.  The salad's white balsamic glaze was light and allowed the fresh ingredients to really pop.From the tasty food to the excellent views, Industry Kitchen was a perfect selection for our corporate lunch.","70 South St New York, NY 10005"
2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Industry Kitchen,"I have a gluten sensitivity and was excited to see a bunch of gluten free options on the industry kitchen menu when I checked it out before going. When ordering my waiter told me the gluten free crust is cooked in the same oven as the regular pizza and isn't on a separate pan or anything. So basically that means it's going to be covered in gluten by the time it gets to me. What's the point of offering gluten free options if it's not safe for anyone with a sensitivity or allergy? I ended up getting the salmon which was fine, but a bit oily. I was with a group of coworkers and we ordered apps and entrees. Entrees came out immediately along with the appetizers. Super annoying that the waiter didn't pace it out. Pretty location and view but wasn't impressed with the food, especially given the prices. Wouldn't go back next time I'm in NYC.","70 South St New York, NY 10005"
2023-09-02,2023-09-16,Industry Kitchen,"First I Had reservations at 6:15 and arrived early and they sat my party so that was very nice! The atmosphere was lovely and they really do a great job making the place feel unique. The drinks were great, not the strongest but good. The food was absolutely amazing! Delicious, overall it was a 10/10 experience","70 South St New York, NY 10005"
2023-09-01,2023-09-16,Industry Kitchen,"3.5 / 5.0 - Industry Kitchen is in the perfect location for outdoor dining on a nice day or evening out. It's spacious and  right by the water facing the river, so you don't have to worry about cars driving by while you're eating, like other restaurants in the city.The food hasn't been amazing, but you're coming here more for the chill waterfront vibe and atmosphere. This time, I tried the Maine Lobster Ravioli ($38+), which was good, but not very warm. The Watermelon & Feta Salad ($17+) was tasty, but not very large.The prices are comparable to other restaurants nearby, so it could be a good option if you're looking for a nice spot to hang out by the water.","70 South St New York, NY 10005"
2023-08-30,2023-09-16,Industry Kitchen,"On my birthday July 25 my sister took me there with two of her kids. We ordered 2 pizzas because the waitress said the kitchen was going to close and that was the only food they could offer. The Margarita pizza only had a few splashes of cheese, the dough was dry and tasteless. Service was horrible, we didn't get any napkins or utensils to eat. No one showed up after the pizza arrived, not even to offer water.","70 South St New York, NY 10005"
2023-08-26,2023-09-16,Industry Kitchen,I am so disappointed as someone that lives in the neighborhood I go to this place all the time - for local repeating customers they treat everyone as a tourist.The food and drinks are good that's not the point.Today I ordered drinks and food by myself and then no one came back to me for like an hour I thought my server left his shift. I went to the bar and asked someone to help - a person came to clear my plates and no one came to my table.30 min later I went to the bar again and asked someone to speak to a manager and the person I asked said they were are manager. I then realized my waiter was a bartender and the manager said my table needs to order from the bar but no one told me that - so I waisted 1.5 hours figuring out what was happening.Very UNPROFESSIONAL!!! And lack of value of my time! I walked out - will come back tomorrow to pay my tab but I will say my time is also valuable and you all need to get your stuff together! Other servers literally on the next table looked at me and said nothing.,"70 South St New York, NY 10005"

2023-08-27,2023-09-16,Sama Street,"I could not be happier that Sama Street is my 100th review.Not only is it one of the best bars in Greenpoint, it's one of the most creative cocktail and food spots in New York, if not the country.The interior is lowlight but low anxiety. The music is kept at a volume that will allow you to hear what your friend is saying while you're actually hanging out. This is a unique concept for some establishments to comprehend.Sama featured not one but two cocktail menus.The first was innovative enough, but then they went full overachiever and set up a specialty cocktail menu. I had the Lucy Liu, which was subtle, light, and refreshing. The Same Same But Different was also clean and citrusy with a mint aroma, and the Rice Rice Baby is in the running for best nog I've ever had. And I make pretty good ones.For food, I only had the Chicken Bao (spicy version). If this is any indicator for the flavorful nature of the other offerings, it's probably all pretty great.Cannot wait to to return.","988 Manhattan Ave Brooklyn, NY 11222"

2023-08-09,2023-09-16,Sama Street,"Wow! 7 long years was an incredible drink , recommended by the bartender. Not too sweet , interesting flavor. Really loved it. The water level of the drink was completely flush with the height of the ice cube and the sesame seeds sat perched in the middle. What a beautiful cocktail:) had the lamb, fries, chicken bar and bok choy. Delicious ! Bok choy was my least favorite as I am not a fan of acidic spice - everything else incredible. Gabriel was so nice !!!","988 Manhattan Ave Brooklyn, NY 11222"

2023-07-10,2023-09-16,Sama Street,"Good food and even better drinks! It was fairly easy to get a reservation on resy a few days before. The space isn't too big, but I liked that it wasn't so crowded! It is a little bit more north of where we usually hang out in Greenpoint, so maybe not as popular yet.Most of the plates are meant to be shared, so I would come with a group to try more things!Faves of the night:- Pork pancake: scallion pancake stuffed with minced pork- Chicken bao: fried chicken in a bao with some yummy sauces! it comes 2 to a order, which I think would've been fine to split between the 4 of us because we ordered so much food- baby bok choy: literally only 4 pieces of bok choy lol, but I loved how charred it was on the outside and crunchy peanuts on top!- Crispy fried rice: ACTUALLY CRISPY! It was like the bottom pieces of rice in a clay pot. great textureEnjoyed, but would pass next time:- pork ribs: Good flavor, but somewhat dry meat- Beef koi: steak tartare with shrimp chips. wasn't bad, but wasn't great- Grilled octopus: hmmm where was the octopus?? lol the cauliflower definitely overpowered and we could barely find the octopus pieces. The very dim lighting also didn't really helpThey have very long list of cocktails that are mostly Asian inspired! I loved all the different flavors and would order the 7 long years again. Try it if you like spicy margs","988 Manhattan Ave Brooklyn, NY 11222"
2023-07-08,2023-09-16,Sama Street,"If you're looking for flavors you won't stop thinking about, good quality that doesn't succumb to trends and an inviting space that makes you feel like home -- this is the place for you. I discovered Sama Street back in September 2022 and have been back almost every month since. It's my favorite place to go out with friends to kick off a weekend. It's my favorite place to take out-of-towners for a good time they'll never forget. And it's my favorite place to discover new ways of eating and drinking.The Major Tom (cocktail) will make you question every thing you've drank up until this point -- it's the best cocktail I've ever had. Followed up with the shroom salad (super herby and bright), the beef koi (if you're a tartare fan), ribs that melt in your mouth and the trusty reliable chicken bao.The team behind it all -- Avi, Rishi, David and the crew -- make every day there an unforgettable one.

Had some fresh oysters with great sauces, drinks were solid, chili cheese fries over the top good. Place has a great vibe to it and everyone seemed to be enjoying the afternoon.","141 Broadway Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2022-07-01,2023-09-16,OTB,"Soupy oysters and bitter parcha cocktails no thanks. Ordered a tiki drink (i know, i know why would I do that there, never good) which came in a bourbon glass and didn't taste as described at all although I did get a whiff of cinnamon occasionally which was nice. My partner's frozen marg did however come in my tiki cup (it was cute) yet like my cocktail was tart (the passion fruit was not ready for harvest). The oyster tasted like they came straight from a salt mine and the vinaigrettes, well I'd rather not comment on that atrocity. Overall I'm beyond sad as I've been wanting to go here for years but there's always somewhere better calling me and well  now I know why my gut told me never to come. Sadly I'll say stay clear if you don't have funds to just waste nilly willy.","141 Broadway Brooklyn, NY 11211"

2023-09-07,2023-09-16,7th Street Burger - Times Square,"Amazing burgers and fries. If you get a chance, get either the Banana or Oreo pudding. Such a wonderful treat - save the calories for this and get a bottle of water instead... or both!Love that they have Mexican coke.Service is super quick and friendly. Bonus is the seating area inside. There are multiple locations around the city, with more coming online. Honestly, this place is better than Five Guys and is my new go-to for a burger in Manhattan.Seeing other reviews where people say to come only when drunk, or the burgers are too thin, they're not wrong entirely, but I will say it's what a burger is really meant to be. A quick bite that fills you up, and for the price point, certainly better than the overpriced mediocre restaurant burgers I've had. Don't write off this place - come try for yourself.","485 7th Ave New York, NY 10018"

The atmosphere of the restaurant is cool and cozy, which contributes to a pleasant dining experience.It is true that the hype around this place is well deserved, as the burgers really stand out in terms of taste and quality. However, it's important to note that these burgers may not meet the definition of a gourmet burger.

Ordered some west coast oysters, they came out the size of my fist, dry, and old. However the staff was very accommodating but my server was MIA. Manny took over and was amazing! He saw that my server was slacking and took care of us. The food was average the carbonara I ordered came out cold, had them heat it up it came out over cooked. Ambience is good for some drinks!

2023-09-02,2023-09-16,Parker & Quinn,"It has the feel of an English pub with an open kitchen.  We had a reservation for 4 pm. Early dinner before heading home. They were serving one other table when we arrived.  There are no crowds on Labor Day weekend so restsurant was empty.We arrived a few minutes before 4. We ordered drinks, West Side Story and the Big City Lights.For appetizers, we had the burrata  and pesto salad and the focaccia and citrus infused Olives. The Olives were out of this world. Each bite of an olive had citrus undertones.Our main meals included 8oz hanger steak with a salad and fries. The steak had great flavor and was perfectly cooked. The other dish was the bronzino with broccoli rabe and bok choy. The bok choy was a bit tough. The fish had great flavor. Would have liked a starchy vegetable with the dish.Overall, it was a great dinner. Wait staff was friendly and very attentive.","64 W 39th St New York, NY 10018"
2023-08-31,2023-09-16,Parker & Quinn,"Parker & Quinn has been on my list of bookmarks for a long time, and I was excited when I had the opportunity to visit while I was in Midtown last week.We wanted to grab some light bites and drinks, so we sat at the bar. We ordered a martini, a glass of rose, calamari and a charcuterie board.The charcuterie board was good, the calamari was pretty disappointing. The squid was really rubbery, the breading tasted a little stale, and the sauce was bland. Visually, it looked nice and I always appreciate a grilled lemon,The server was very nice and attentive. But I was surprised when I got the bill and saw a $24 charge for a glass of rose. Looking back at the menu, a typical 5oz glass is $15, and an 8oz glass is $24. It was big glass of wine, and I have no problem with that price tag for the extra oz. However, when we ordered a ""glass of rose"" the server should've asked if we wanted 5oz or 8oz.The restaurant was packed for a Wednesday at 10pm. It's obvious people really enjoy this restaurant, and I might be back if I have the opportunity.","64 W 39th St New York, NY 10018"

2023-08-26,2023-09-16,Parker & Quinn,"The server, Corey, was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. The atmosphere was overall nice. It's very dark and the menu print is light and small so get your phone lights ready to read. lol Do not order the boards. For $25+ it's a waste. The meat board had 3 pcs each of 3 different meats, 3 pieces of bread, couple of olives. It was a waste of money. The chicken sliders came out burnt the first time. Why they would ever serve that is beyond me. They were good when they came out the second time. The bianca pizza was good but the sundried tomatoes were either missing or so small you couldn't see or taste them. Prices are a bit high for what you get. There are so many places in the city to try. I'm not sure that I would go back.","64 W 39th St New York, NY 10018"

I thought they were very soft on the inside but could have been a little more crunchy. The sauce given with them was good! For mains, I ordered the Olive Oil pancakes and Shakshuka Egg which were both very good! The olive oil pancakes were not too sweet and very tasty. The Shakshuka had good flavor!

The service was also good. My favorite food item was the olive oil pancakes, which were soft and moist. The Avocado toast was plain with barely any avocado, which was a disappointment. They did give us a side of extra Avocado when we brought it to their attention. However, the additional charge for the Avocado took away from the gesture/hospitality. The crispy rice cubes lacked flavor but had great texture.Overall, it had a great ambiance but so-so food.","52 W 13th St New York, NY 10011"

What I really liked was the ambiance, it reminded me of the Philippines and how it's a restaurant that has an entrance like you would see in the stores in the Philippines. The service was good, the people were friendly and it was nice. The food was great, I got the adobong manok (chicken adobo) and the flavors just blended so well it was too strong with the vinegar nor was it too salty with the soy sauce.

The maja blanca was interesting in texture (jiggly and a little chewy) but what threw me off was that there was corn in it. Overall the desserts here are not at all too sweet so if that's what you like you'll be happy. Decorations inside the shop are cute but not too much space to sit.,"151 Allen St New York, NY 10002"

I felt like it either lacked flavor or it was just super super salty. It was annoying going back and forth to refill the water ourselves. I wished we were able to have a jug of water at the table.The dessert with the strawberry ice cream on top with mixed jellies was disappointing.

Goes well with the crunch of potato chips.The lobster is moist with texture that is not too chewy. Lightly seasoned without it being overwhelming or mushy. The buttery bread was so warm and toasty.

2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Friedman's,"Absolutely fantastic! Do you crave a delightful eatery with impeccable service and top-notch cuisine? Look no further than Friedman's! This was my initial stop after a grueling 9-hour flight into Manhattan, and it exceeded all expectations. New York City can be a whirlwind of activity and Friedman's is no exception. The hustle and bustle are part of the NYC charm, especially for those visiting for the first time. To make the most of your visit and secure the best seating and accommodations for your party, I strongly recommend making a reservation in advance.My group of four enjoyed a comfortable spot in the heart of the restaurant, immersing ourselves in the lively brunch atmosphere. The staff were courteous and swift in attending to our needs. Our food and drinks arrived promptly, and refills were readily available. Our drink glasses were never left empty, a testament to the attentive service. Every member of the team displayed a sense of urgency and genuine care.","132 W 31st St New York, NY 10001"

2023-08-31,2023-09-16,Friedman's,"Subpar breakfast experience. They told us that the orange juice is freshly squeezed but it really tasted and looked like minute maid, so we weren't so sure about that. And this might be picky of us but the water was clearly tap. For a breakfast place on the nicer end we kind of expected more. They didn't check up on us the whole time we were eating, only to seat us and bring the bill, which we had to flag them down for. The banana bread was alright, nothing special, and the avocado toast was okay as well, although the egg was really lacking in flavor. The fish tacos were actually pretty good, but not memorable enough for us to want to come back. Overall not the worst but not the best experience, but we will not be back, especially cause it wasn't worth the almost $100 we paid.","132 W 31st St New York, NY 10001"

2023-08-27,2023-09-16,Peaches Prime,"I really enjoyed my time at Peaches Prime for several reasons. The first, being that no one was what some know as 'Swag Surfing over my food during our midday brunch, though I've surf-danced with the best of them during some bottomless brunches.Anyway, Peaches Prime had an elegant vibe and was quite reserved. There weren't many people there on the Sunday afternoon in the summer. The ambiance was absolutely lovely and the atmosphere was calm with the best music (lightly played hip-hop and R&B). It was so easy to make a reservation through their website and I was grateful that they offered this option.Upon our arrival, we were seated immediately and our waitress came right over. I didn't get her name but she was so friendly and enthusiastic. She took our orders and answered questions about the menu with detailed explanations. Our food came out very quickly and included the Jim Cade breakfast and the oxtail fettuccine - both were delicious and filling.I was very satisfied with the ambiance, vibe, food and service. Also, the restaurant is in a great location. What would make the establishment even better are more menu options. It's definitely a vibe though!","590 Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-08-21,2023-09-16,Peaches Prime,Delicious food. Cozy ambiance. Friendly service. They have live music every Wednesday evening. The singer(s) and band are definitely a vibe.,"590 Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-08-17,2023-09-16,Peaches Prime,"Stopped in for dinner last minute. We were seated and served promptly. Food came out super quick. Everything, I mean everything! Was delicious. We kept saying ""I didn't expect x to be so good!"" Appetizers are a nice, shareable size. The oysters Rockefeller were a hit. The calamari was also good. I loved the Caesar salad. The salmon entree was amazing, as were the broccoli and whipped potato sides. Desserts aren't printed on the menu but still available and worth asking about.","590 Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11217"

2023-07-30,2023-09-16,Peaches Prime,"I had the pleasure of dining here on a Saturday evening and the experience was great from start to finish. The decor is like an upscale cafeteria, an open kitchen leads you to dining room with tons of booth seat opportunities and gorgeous lighting that gets dimmed and candles with actual flames come out after sunset. I think it would be a perfect date night spotOur waiter was a sweetheart and recommended my drink, which I really enjoyed. Its called nuts for you or nuts about you or something along those lines and its a warm citrus-y sweet cocktail. I can't comment on potency because i was drinking prior but the taste was incredible. We received complimentary fried grits that were served atop an herby green sauce and when I come back, I'll definitely get the full sized version. It was crunchy on the outside and creamy in the middle and such a good bite through and through. The fried calamari had a bit too much breading, but they were prepared well, otherwise, and weren't super chewy. The oysters rockefeller were my favorite out of the three starters, the creamed spinach was perfect and deserved to be in a bowl on their own. Our two entrees were the ribeye and the branzino. The ribeye was so tender, you could cut it with a butter knife!!!! It was prepared medium rare just to my liking and I was doing a happy dance the entire time I was eating it. There wasn't much seasoning on it but the onions and sauce served with it added to flavor. The mashed potatoes are probably the best mashed potatoes I've ever had and I would pay for the recipe. They're so simple, you could tell that they used actual potatoes and not the instant pack and it was just perfect. There was just enough salt, garlic, sour cream or whatever they used to create this bowl of heaven. And the serving size was enough for me to eat with my meal and have as a leftover breakfast the next day. The branzino was moist and the sauce wasn't overbearing at all. For dessert, we went with the pound cake and requested a bowl of ice cream and it came with crispy, buttery edges, warm blueberries ontop and fresh whipped cream on the side. HeavenlyAs we received our check, we also got two thin and crispy chocolate chip cookies, also complimentary. The texture made them so fun to eat.This restaurant is definitely one of my current favorites right now. Everything we ordered off the menu was delicious, with good portions and a reasonable price","590 Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-07-25,2023-09-16,Peaches Prime,"We loved our meal at this upscale offshoot of Peaches Hothouse! The food, drinks and service were all fantastic, and prices were very reasonable for the portion size and quality. We shared the fried calamari and Brussels as starters. The calamari was very crisp and not at all greasy, and the Brussels were nicely charred. My cousin had a Caesar salad that he loved. For mains, husband had the fried chicken, and I had the sole with crab butter. Both were delicious. However, unlike the Hothouse, fried chicken does not come with a choice of spice level - it's no spice at all, although there is hot sauce on the table. For dessert, we shared the cheesecake, which was incredibly light. I will absolutely be returning.","590 Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-07-14,2023-09-16,Peaches Prime,"The ambiance of the restaurant is sleek and chic. Servers and hosts are friendly and attentive. However the pros end there.The food was kind of a let down. We had the Crispy Oysters Rockefeller - too salty, the creamed greens tasted a bit foul; mushroom paella - the rice was hard and chewy while the mushrooms were bitter; and the peri peri branzino - sauce was great, fish was cooked okay and served on a bed of sautéed cabbage that was also present in the mushroom paella - tasted oily and sour.Too many restaurants in the area to give this one a second shot. Most likely won't be coming back.","590 Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11217"

2023-05-14,2023-09-16,Peaches Prime,I went in to grab some apps and a drink afterwork.  I ordered Crispy Oysters Rockefeller which was so delish. I had a smoky Moscow mule that delivered (I'm picky about my drinks).  I took dinner to go and ordered the oxtail fettuccine dish. I was a bit disappointed. It was more oily than I would have liked and was lacking flavor.Would I return? Absolutely. I have more dishes to try and the service was great.,"590 Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-05-13,2023-09-16,Peaches Prime,"Okay so there's plenty Peaches restaurants in BK. This was my first experience at Peaches Prime. Prime describes that neck of the woods. It's located directly across the street from the BAM, Harvey theater and underneath some very pricey apartment and business units.Here it goes...Flavorful garlic shrimp scampi, served in a mini skillet with toast slices. Broiled lemon sole with crab butter topping on a bed of sautéed spinach was tasty. My dining companions enjoyed the crispy calamari and their salads. I skipped the complimentary fried grits bites but they looked tasty enough. I wish that my Moscow Mule would have been served in the standard tin cup. It makes a difference (to me at least.)My Key Lime Pie slice with burnt meringue topping was a deliciously sweet end to a great meal overall. There was a mention at my table of grilled salmon being overly salty. Peaches Prime has music playing but it sounds like they're just selecting ""whatever"" from satellite radio.I would find my way there again on a weekday for Happy Hour. The bar is super cute. Our waitress was very accommodating. Good stuff.","590 Fulton St Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-08-26,2023-09-16,Llama Inn,"Started great, we sat at the bar, ordered a few drinks and apps. We finished our apps, and before we had a chance to order a second round of drinks, we were given the bill - even though we didn't ask for it. Before we could clarify that we planned to order more, the bartender walked away. At that point we agreed to go elsewhere. Over priced, pretentious, and as a Peruvian, much better food elsewhere. Forget this place, try Mission Ceviche in the UES.","50 Withers St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-08-21,2023-09-16,Llama Inn,"The flavors are really bold and bright, and the ceviche was delicious. The sauces are so good I would buy a bottle as a salad dressing. The only thing is that the portions are really small for the price. Even at a similarly priced restaurant in Williamsburg, I leave pretty full, but here we were still hungry enough to grab pizza after a pretty hefty bill","50 Withers St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-08-15,2023-09-16,Llama Inn,"Wow! This place is absolutely outstanding!We went for brunch on the later side of the afternoon and it just blew me away. We started with coffee and tea which were both very tasty. The service was extremely attentive and they explained each dish in detail when they were dropped. We ordered the fluke ceviche, lomo saltado, and the big breakfast. The ceviche was so fresh and bright. It was an extremely memorable dish. I loved the flavors of the blood sausage and pork shoulder in the big breakfast, just so tasty. The star of the show was 100% the lomo saltado. Beneath that bed of McDonald's-esque french fries and sauce was this brothy, beautiful stew like dish consistent of bananas and sirloin. Just outstanding.The ambiance was stunning. The restaurant is just so well thought. We were there for a while and actually didn't notice that the staff had sat down for their family meal before dinner started. The fact that they let us sit there with us and didn't kick us out really says something about this place. They have something really special going here and you should make the visit if you're in or around Williamsburg.","50 Withers St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

2023-08-07,2023-09-16,Llama Inn,"On a random side street in Brooklyn, adjacent to a small hotel and a freeway overpass, is an unlikely location to find such a wonderful gem, but Llama Inn is truly a Peruvian oasis in the city.  I went for Saturday brunch with some friends and was absolutely astonished to find plenty of street parking right in front of the restaurant!  Walking in, you're immediately greeted by art with bright, vibrant colors against a cheery white background and tables surrounding a chic central bar.  Once upstairs, it's like you've left Brooklyn.  The rooftop is stunningly gorgeous, with tropical vibes, comfy seating and some areas with more overhead coverage for those not wishing to experience the full brunt of the sun.  It's a real moment.  Unfortunately for my party, although I did have rooftop reservations, the only table available was fully exposed to the sun on a nearly 90 degree Fahrenheit day, so we sashayed our sundresses back inside before imminent make-up melt down could occur.I started with a Llama Del Rey, a refreshing pisco and red wine based sparkling drink that was reminiscent of red sangria.  Most of the cocktails had cute, cheeky names which added to the festive brunch feeling.  We ordered chips and dip for the table which were quite good.  The chips tasted fresh.  The winning appetizer however, was the ceviche with calamari, lime, red onion and cilantro.  It was zesty and flavorful.  For a main I had a generous sized breakfast platter with scrambled eggs, brioche toast, blood sausage and pork shoulder tamal.  I hurt myself trying to eat it all because it was soooooo good.  I mean I had to do some major dress adjustments to account for my distended abdomen afterwards, but it was worth it!  Biting through the firm texture of the blood sausage casing created a great juxtaposition with the soft, friable, savory filling.  The pork shoulder in the tamale was tender, succulent and bold in flavor.  I can't recall the last time, if ever, I had better pork.  One of my friends had the fried rice omlette which was also delicious.  For desert, I loved the elevated take on flan with crushed macadamia nuts and crème de mint topping.  The sorbet with frozen grapes beautifully assembled on top was another fantastic choice on a warm summer day.Everyone from the host to the servers was extremely personable and helpful.  The restaurant was also playing a mix of Beyoncé and Aaliyah that morning, so my friends and I had a blast.  If you're looking for a place with fun atmosphere and delicious food, check out this spot.","50 Withers St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-08-04,2023-09-16,Llama Inn,Dude.... The squid ceviche with that sauce... the wagyu lomo saltado...omg. Nice bohemian tulum-y vibes. Clay plates and cups not only is the place a vibe but it's one of those rare gems in NY. The food was nothing short of an explosion of flavor in my mouth,"50 Withers St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-07-30,2023-09-16,Llama Inn,"Haven't heard a single bad thing about Llama Inn and it had been on my summer bucket eats so when my friend asked me to brunch, of course I immediately said yes. Should preface this by saying I lived in Peru for about a month and am a huge fan of Peruvian food, but have found it difficult to come by.We went on Sunday at 2 pm and had a reservation, but it was pretty empty so don't think it's necessary to make one. We asked the server for recommendations and glad we did, because everything was delicious. I'm not much of a drinker for brunch so opted for a drip coffee which was very good. Hard to find good black coffee so I was already pretty impressed with just that.We split everything between the two of us-- ordered the fluke ceviche to start and the lomo saltado and the big breakfast. The ceviche was very good, which came in leche de tigre. Very tart and a little spicy, accompanied by corn and some sweet potatoes. I found the fish to be a bit of a thick cut, but I think that's just a preference.The big breakfast came out next, which has toast, a tamal, pork shoulder, blood sausage, and scrambled eggs. This is a great dish to share as it's plated like a little spread and you can pick at the various items. The meat was very tender and the seasoning was unique and paired wonderfully with the crema.The lomo saltado came out next and this thing was massive. It had the meat on the bottom topped with french fries, two eggs, banana and crema. Also comes with a side of rice. The sauce for the meat was also another acidic vinegar-based concoction which was delicious. The fries on top were super crispy and reminiscent of McDonalds fries (my favorite) while the ones on the bottom got soaked up in the vinegar sauce which were delicious with the meat and eggs. It was a lot of food, but there are few things I enjoy as much as a long slow meal with conversation and we did a pretty good job making our way through almost everything after some time.We lingered here til past 4:30 and the service here was really great. Also a very cute interior with nice spacing between the seats, making it a relaxed vibe. I'm really not much of a bruncher, but this brunch may have changed my perspective! Overall, I think this goes without saying but if you don't like tart acidic flavors full of lime and vinegar, this spot (or Peruvian cuisine as a whole) may not be to your liking.","50 Withers St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-07-30,2023-09-16,Llama Inn,Amazing Peruvian infused food. We had a group of six and had almost everything on the menu. The menu is small yet every dish is expertly crafted. This is a must stop in Brooklyn and if weather permits sit outside on the rooftop terrace.,"50 Withers St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-07-25,2023-09-16,Llama Inn,"Oh where can I even start ??? This place absolutely blew my mind. We came here for brunch while visiting, this place was a James beard nominee, so we had to give it a try. The ambiance of the place was wonderful and was very tropical inside. Lots of plants and open air space that really set the mood. Our server and host were extremely helpful, guiding with preferred menu choices and cocktails to begin our tasteful journey. We had several appetizers and each one had unique flavor profiles that were rather pleasing to the palette. The oysters had to be my favorite for sure. The cocktails each had select Peruvian liquors that matched well with all of the dishes. We all tried other things on the menu ranging from the pork shoulder, chicken thigh and mushroom toast. Every bite was cherished! I would love to return here. They said their dinner menu was even better. !","50 Withers St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Alligator Pear,"I was really hoping to give this beautiful NOLA inspired restaurant 5 stars, but unfortunately, the seating situation kind of tainted the experience. I had made reservations the day prior and was super excited to catch up with one of my best friends after work here. I was running a few minutes behind so I started rushing and when I got there, I noticed the restaurant wasn't even packed. I was surprised that we were taken to the upstairs area and were seated in this awkward hallway in the dark, right across from an exit door and the restrooms. It was very bizarre. At one point, one of the workers was restocking the restrooms with toilet paper and it was just a bit awkward seeing all of that from the table we were seated at. We looked down and could see the tables in the main dining area were empty for a while. I think the host should have asked if we wanted an intimate area because then I guess it would have worked. Our server was actually super sweet, and she wasn't the one who sat us so this had nothing to do with her.Besides all that, the food was pretty good. The corn bread was actually very delicious and the Aperol spritz I ordered was perfect as well. I was very much looking forward to the gumbo, which was good, however, the potato salad that's put in the middle of it, definitely threw me off. I thought it was a bit too heavy with the Mayo and probably would have preferred rice instead of it. My friend agreed since we both ordered the same gumbo.I think I would come back to give this spot another shot and hopefully update my review to a better experience!","150 W 30th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Alligator Pear,"We were so excited to try this new NOLA inspired place but ended up being pretty disappointed with the experience. Firstly the blonde host seated us in the very back corner of the restaurant, inside a dark private room that had a large corporate party already seated - completely secluded from the main part of the restaurant with the decor, vibe etc. When I asked her if we could have another table in the main part of the restaurant, she said sure and proceeded to give us another table. 5 minutes after we're seated and about to order drinks, she comes back to tell us the table she just seated us at was actually reserved, and asks us to move to another table in the back upstairs. Huh? We had a reservation also, so why should we have to move, again? After telling her no she tried to go back and forth with us and eventually ended up walking away and avoiding us for the rest of the night.Our server was ok except for him repeatedly rushing us to order our entrees 4 times, instead of just telling us upfront that the kitchen was closing soon. Service is definitely a huge miss here.On the bright side - the crab beignets and gumbo were really amazing. The charbroiled oysters, and alligator bites were good.The stew especially and Nola paella rice however were not flavorful at all.This restaurant has a lot of potential and it's understandable that they are fairly new. But as of now, it doesn't even come close to NOLA - the decor is a bit superficial/cheesy, hospitality is anything but southern, and the food is just ok. Maybe we'll try it again in a year or so when the kinks are hopefully figured out. As of now the vibe is a gentrified New Orleans.","150 W 30th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Alligator Pear,"I was pretty intrigued with this place given they adopted the Nola concept, something that I don't really think exists in nyc. The place was definitely a bit swankier than I thought it would be. The ambiance was nice, but honestly it felt a bit superficial, appealing to people wanting to take trendy pictures and such.The service was not really that great. As of this review the restaurant is pretty new, so I'm sure they are working out the kinks. Food comes out fast. We went with the gumbo, jambalaya, Mac and cheese appetizer, and the alligator bites.Mac and cheese and the bites were both fine, but honestly quite forgettable. Was a big fan of the jambalaya though, and the gumbo was tasty. Small portions though. However I'm pretty sure none of this would stand up to the food served in New Orleans.Is it a novel concept, sure. But it's criminally overpriced, and frankly this place seems to be riding on its trendiness, rather than the heart and soul of any restaurant, which is it's food.","150 W 30th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Alligator Pear,"It was a pretty big restaurant and although we made a reservation, we probably didn't need it. Overall, things were good but wish the portion size was bigger for everything besides the jumbalaya.Cornbread: we got a full loaf but it comes out as 2 mini loaves. It was good and comes with a brown sugar butter that went well together. I just wish it was bigger.Blue crab beignets: this was a great appetizer, and the flavors were interesting together (i.e. spicy honey). It comes in 4 pieces.Rubbed pork collar: This was the best thing tied with the beignets. It was super tender and the pecan sauce was interesting to pair with it. The portion size was small though - cut up into 7 pieces.NOLA Jambalaya for 2: This had the largest portion size and helped to fill us up the most. Shrimp was not overcooked and there was enough sausages as well. A very decent entree.Beignets: comes in orders of 3 so we had to order 2. They come in bags of powdered sugar and freshly fried. It was a little denser than the ones I remember in NOLA but still good. Just pricey at almost $5 per beignet for the size.","150 W 30th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-13,2023-09-16,Alligator Pear,"I came here for my friends birthday dinner. It was 5 of us. This place has a beautiful ambiance and the drinks are good!- i had the voodoo hurricane which was really good and strong.- The cornbread wasn't that great it was really dry!! -The jambalaya was very salty like they were trying to fix the flavor by just adding salt or maybe the sausage had alot of sodium which made the dish salty? Idk but it has potential to me fixed.-My friend had the gnocchi and OMG when they put that plate in front of her everyone's eyebrows went up it was the tiniest plate of food i ever seen. She thought it was a mistake because literally it was 6 quarter size gnocchi on her plate! No proteins , vegetable , garnish , nothing! Very ridiculous.Overall i might come back to try something else, but it may be a while.","150 W 30th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Alligator Pear,"The charm, the flavors, and the warmth of the staff, pay true homage to the South where you can feast on extraordinary flavors you can't find anywhere else in NYC.The cocktails are unique, special & tasty! We tried the Pear Caiman & the Hurricane - both were great! The entire food menu is enticing, but we started with tempura alligator bites, blue crab beignets, corn bread & brussel sprouts. For entrees it's recommended to share a few with your group and we had great dishes. Our favorites were the fried chicken & the amazing creole gnocchi.For dessert we of course had to order the beignets & were extremely impressed by the bread pudding. I can't wait to come back and try more menu items, this is such a special spot. This is a great spot near Madison Square Garden to have a great meal or cocktail. They have a large upstairs area that is perfect for a big group & this restaurant is definitely worth the visit.

2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Alligator Pear,"A sprawling New Orleans eatery and bar recently made its debut in Chelsea this week. The establishment is divided into several distinct dining areas, with a prominent bar on the main floor and additional rooms on the second floor. Opting for the bar, we settled in to soak up the atmosphere while indulging in some culinary and libation exploration.Our beverage choices included a New Orleans beer, Anita, and, of course, a Sazerac with rye substituting the traditional cognac. To accompany our drinks, we savored char-broiled oysters infused with garlic butter and a hearty serving of Jambalaya featuring shrimp and sausage. Although we had intentions of delving further into the menu and trying more beverages, the experience felt somewhat chaotic as first-time visitors.While we contemplate returning to sample the gumbo, our initial impression was less than stellar, leaving us with mixed feelings about the overall experience.","150 W 30th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-09,2023-09-16,Alligator Pear,"I was alerted about alligator pear through OpenTable and how you were able to make reservations. As I am someone who loves New Orleans based food, I had to see what this place was about and if the food. Me and my best friend came on a Friday night, they say me down quickly and waitress attended to me as I waited for my friend to show up.I did not expect the restaurant to be as big as it was and we'll decorated. I love how chill and casual of the restaurant with elegance and people were dressed all differently considering the place.The food was well seasoned and portioned that we ended up taking our jambalayas home. I can't wait to come dine here again!","150 W 30th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-09,2023-09-16,Alligator Pear,"My wife and I visited to celebrate her book launch. Her book is NOLA-themed, so we pondered what's the best NOLA restaurant in NYC? Based on reviews, menu, and cocktails we landed on Alligator Pear.When we arrived the house sound system was pumping Wild Ttchoupitoulas, Trombone Shorty, and Professor Longhair so we thought, ""we made a good choice."" We were greeted and seated upstairs. The place is vast with bars on two floors and alcoves for tables adjacent to high-top counters.We ordered drinks and food. Cocktails were superb. My wife had an Amoxicilin mocktail and mine was a boozy favorite, a Vieux Carrè - using Chicory-infused Vermouth is a great touch. The chicory's bitter bite and the Vermouth's sweetness swirled nicely.Our appetizer was Alligator Pear's vaunted Tempura Alligator Bites. Crispy, non-greasy crust was tasty but of the 5 - 6 pieces in the basket only 2 or 3 of them had alligator meat. Ultimately not a great value at $21.My wife's entrée was NOLA Jambalaya and mine Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. We also ordered cornbread and roasted beets as sides. Wife's jambalaya was under-seasoned and the rice gummy and dense. It had consistency of sitting for a while after being made earlier. My gumbo was disappointing. No discernable chicken in the bowl and the broth was way too salty.Dessert proved not to be much better. Brown Butter Cake was hyper-sweet and had a dry texture that felt like it too, sat deep in the refrigerator, was left out to reach room temperature and then plated. Overall disappointment. The $8 half-loaf of cornbread was the best thing we ate from a menu of dishes in the $24 - 30 range. For the record, our tab was $175.28 ++.Alligator Pear seems to have an identity crisis. It promises (and prices) a high-end dining experience, but the food falls short of anything beyond mild approval. With its busy bar business and happy hour scene it feels more like a New Orleans-themed sports bar.Little things too. As I said earlier, the NOLA music was playing, and it felt like the real thing. But then the music segued from The Dixie Cups to 70s and 80s era disco. A DJ had taken over and was spinning his own thing. When I asked him if he had some Neville Brothers or other NOLA music, he didn't know what that was, and said the restaurant had asked him to play disco. Just seemed off.Makes me miss Paul Prudhomme.","150 W 30th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Alligator Pear,Real nice place ! Food was on point and all very flavorful. Definitely has beignets reminiscent to the ones I had in New Orleans. Ambiance was great.

I will say the interior of this hole in the wall restaurant is gorgeous and reminds me a lot of restaurant in Miami. I ordered the Salmon bowl and boy did it not disappoint. The bowl had so much flavor, especially the pickled radish. I will say that the pickled radish could be overwhelming for some; however, great dish paired with the salmon, egg, and quinoa. Delicious! Would recommend for something refreshing on a hot summer day (which it was that day). The service was okay... nothing to crazy but still welcoming.","251 Church St New York, NY 10013"

A lot of the items featured eggs.I opted for the chicken bowl with a salmon filet instead of chicken, which was an additional $5. They first accidentally brought out my meal with both salmon and chicken, so I had a longer wait than my friends. Besides that, service was good!I enjoyed my bowl, which was filling! The salmon, pickled jicama, and sweet potato were all very flavorful. I did think the salmon portion could have been bigger and that the base of the bowl, which was kale and barely, was a bit too dry.","251 Church St New York, NY 10013"
2023-04-14,2023-09-16,Two Hands,"This is a cozy spot for dinner. The food is very good here, but you can end up paying an arm and a leg for it.Pork Belly and Cheddar Croquettes: These were great. I think these were better priced and sized than the Rod and Reel Market Fish. Would certainly order these again. The pork belly was flavorful and prominent; the coating was crispy and the plating overall was nice.Rod and Reel Market Fish: This is a shared plate at $38. This dish was delicious, but the portions are too small for this to be a shared plate -- it is essentially a dish for 1 marked up x2. That said, the salmon was perfectly cooked and juicy; the crunchy coating worked perfectly here as well. Adding to it all, the accompanying fruit paired perfectly -- mostly blood oranges I believe.

2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Szechuan Mountain House,"4.5/5 I can't believe I haven't reviewed Szechuan Mountain House! I freaking love this place! Their wait times are usually horrible for dinner (I waited for two hours one time for dinner, it was so worth it at that time because the food was amazing) but now I know to come right at opening :DThe food is authentically spicy, to the point where I usually can't even finish the dishes. But I love it!Pepper Cony Meat: this is rabbit meat and it's sooo darn spicy! But the flavors are sooo good. Very spicy, very salty, just very flavorful. While I really enjoyed this, it's a pain to eat because there are a lot of bones as it's diced very small. So just be careful when eating, you gotta be very meticulous to not choke haha. The waitress was kind and warned us that it would contain a lot of bones, but we were undeterred lolPepper Beef Tongue: I've been unimpressed by tongue before but they do it well here! It tastes very meaty, doesn't have a weird taste, and it's sliced super thin. It is definitely oily, but there are some cucumbers at the bottom to cut through the grease a bitMung Bean Jelly: I love their slippery cold noodles, with a great bounce and the sauce for it is spicy and yummy. I always order thisSwing Pork Belly: cutest presentation, delicious sauce, super thin piecesHouse Tomato Fish Stew (black fish): they also warned about the abundance of bones in this dish but I wish I had listened to the warning for this one because it was really hard to pick out the bones for this soup. It's a very pungent tomato flavor, but not really my thing, so I probably wouldn't order this. I also didn't like the taste of the fish itself.Country Braised Pork: I love the way they do the vegetable in this one, the pork use has a good meat to fat ration, and is incredibly tender. It's just such a fatty dish tho haha. But one of their dishes that has no spice so a really good palate cleanserThey used to have this intestines and clams dish that was absolutely my favorite thing to order and it was AMAZING. Sadly I didn't see it on the menu the last time I went, but they way they cook intestines is superrr tasty","23 St Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"

We came around 6:30 on a Saturday with a group of 7 and waited over 3 hours to get seated.That said, this is the best Szechuan food I've had in the US.

There was no dish that disappointed.From the great decorations, to the friendly wait staff, and of course the excellent food, this is on my short list of restaurants I would fly across the country for.","23 St Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"

2023-08-21,2023-09-16,Szechuan Mountain House,I have very peculiar perceptions of food and recently started expanding my taste palette. The pork intestine stir fry might not be for the faint of heart but imo was absolutely amazing and is what I'd come back exclusively for. Every bite was perfect in flavor and texture with this dish. The fish soup we got was also a hit as well - not too spicy and numbing at all and the fish itself was tender and flavorful. I do suggest ordering extra rice on the side to complement anything you get here.,"23 St Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-15,2023-09-16,Szechuan Mountain House,I'm a huge fan of spicy food and this restaurant definitely doesn't disappoint with the spiciness. Very authentic Chinese food. I enjoyed the pork belly swing a lot!,"23 St Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-06,2023-09-16,Szechuan Mountain House,"Really amazing food! You have to get the Swing Pork Belly, the presentation is super cute and it's perfectly balanced.

2023-08-05,2023-09-16,Szechuan Mountain House,"One word: woooooooow. I've tried a few Szechuan spots at this point, but no place compares to this one. Love at first bite with each dish.I love all things spicy. Each dish I ordered was spicy, but had different flavor profiles. It was a different experience with each dish. Prior to this restaurant,  I never understood the hype with mapo tofu... but the one here changed my outlook! The mapo tofu here was such a good surprise - it melts in your mouth and the meat flavors weren't too overpowering (which is a bonus for me).The spicy fish dish is my usual order in Szechuan spots. We shared that dish among 4 total people and that filled us up. I love that this place actually puts a lot of fish in there and it's worth the price point.Definitely recommend this spot. Make some reservations before you go. I will be returning again to satisfy my spice cravings!","23 St Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"
2023-07-30,2023-09-16,Szechuan Mountain House,"This is the best Szechuan food I've had in New York, hands-down. The spice is properly numbing and works very well with the flavors of the dishes, rather than just being superfluous and painful. If you like Szechuan food, or, more importantly, if you've never liked Szechuan food before, you must give this place a try!","23 St Marks Pl New York, NY 10003"

We flag him down (he hasn't checked on us) and he says, ""Oh, the kitchen says they sent it back out."" Well, do you see a bowl on the table? Did you bring one to her? There were all of 10 people eating in the cafe at that time. When she finally did get it, she said it the dish was spicy even though the menu didn't say it would be.

They have pretty solid shakes, I like the mocha-pb-protein shake. They have very good cold brew. Pro tip is to sign up for their mobile app and then scan table QR code for the order because you can rack up rewards points easily that way. I usually end up getting a $5 coupon every other visit based on points. They have a good togo service as well through the app. Sometimes I will order togo on my way to the skatepark for example and they usually have it ready on time , or just small wait.","55 Prospect St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

Loved their chocolate croissant-flakey and the chocolate inside was delicious and didn't taste processed like some I've had. Regular croissant also lived up to the flakiness. The only bad thing was they don't heat up the pastries which i think would've made it even better. The cranberry orange muffin was also so yummy that we got another one before we left. Lattes were stellar and smooth. Plus the latte art was so pretty! They have a separate area near the window if you wanted to sit and do work vibes which we also did after eating! Definitely plan to go back and try some other things on their menu!,"55 Prospect St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

2023-09-01,2023-09-16,Lingo,"4.5/5, rounding up. A calmingly curated space, Lingo was a delicious spot for my first dinner in Brooklyn.We got the following:- Miso eggplant (5/5!): So good. I love eggplant dishes, and this one shines with its sweet and umami flavoring. Of course the burrata was indulgent as well.- Shishito tempura (4/5): I'm not a big fan of shishito as a lot of places usually over-salt them. Not the case for this one.- Corn fried rice (3/5): too salty unfortunately :(- Scallop noodles: (5/5): Wow these scallops are so well made (not overcooked). Probably the best scallop I've had in a while.- Plum and black sesame panna cotta (4.5/5): yum, very black sesameMy only qualm with the space is that it was pretty cramped where we were seated. There's an island counter holding the plants in the main room, which the servers had to squeeze by whenever coming around to the tables.","27 Greenpoint Ave Brooklyn, NY 11222"
2023-08-27,2023-09-16,Lingo,"This was a very cute, young and hip restaurant in Greenpoint that explores Japanese American flavors.We were warmly greeted and walked to our table. The tables were pretty close to each other. I was afraid of knocking over my neighbors' glasses of water and I'm not a big person.We shared the milk bread, which was surprisingly not as good as I was expecting. The fried corn and shishito tempura was pretty good. The miso eggplant and burrata was interesting in that I wasn't used to the burrata being essentially texture less. It tasted more like a foam accompaniment than a part of the main attraction. The crispy cauliflower was my favorite of the apps.We then shared the expertly fried chicken! It was a little messy/hard to eat but it was a phenomenal dish.I think definitely  worth giving this place at least one try!","27 Greenpoint Ave Brooklyn, NY 11222"

The scallop somen noodle was really light - I almost got scared off by the bottarga, but it wasn't too funky at all. The beef pie was the star of the show though, rich and thick, with a crust that's more bready than flaky.The only downside for me was the server was checking in way too often. I appreciate attentiveness, but multiple times per each dish was a little much.","27 Greenpoint Ave Brooklyn, NY 11222"

The interior was inviting and nicely decorated. The pillows on the back tables look like something I would have in my crib (jealous)! All jokes aside the food was delicious, especially the eggs Benny,m. It was def different from what you would consider an eggs Benedict. It had a thick cut toasted to perfection sourdough bread, and spam, which was also very savory underneath the eggs. It was accompanied by a well seasoned arugula salad, and was the perfect meal if you had a couple of cocktails the night before. My friend had the Instagram were the pancakes, and even though the milk bread was good, it definitely was an afterthought, and we could've done it without. Only downside to my experience, it was a bit of a wait for the food to come out and my wife received her food about five minutes before I received my entrée, it's all good though they kept the coffee flowing!!

Bolognese was ok, but not super flavorful and the other two had weird aftertaste and overcooked pasta. On the positive side, portions were quite large.Place was very understaffed and service providers were nice, but clearly too overburdened to provide adequate service.Reminds me of some tourist trap Italian joint you would find by Time Square.

I am left with a strange salty aftertaste twenty minutes later and a vague argument with my girlfriend about her not trying the mussels. And the mussels were the only thing that I could call good. The broth they sat in was rich and unusual in the best way. The other side we got was the veal meatballs which were tender but had no nuance in their flavor. For our main we ordered the chicken parm which disappointed by its lack of crunch and taste. The same red sauce that was on the meatballs must have been on the parm because by then it had gone bland in my mouth. While everything was passable this is by no means where you should go for a fine dining experience. If you want to shell out, go somewhere else, you will be more satisfied.

2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Hakata Tonton,"My friends and I were looking for Japanese food for dinner and stumbled upon this place. The decor of this place looked cool. It was simple and very modern. We ordered a plethora of dishes.Roast beef- This dish was okay. The roast beef was tender but the flavor wasn't screaming at me.Mentai Gnocchi- Solid. It tasted as if the gnocchi was dusted with Cheeto dust. Subtlety chewy and texture was A+.Goma Hamachi- My favorite dish of the night. Sweet, fresh, and accompanied with the sauce it was oh so flavorful. Umami bursts were everywhere.Beef Tongue- Very chewy, but tender overall, comes with a ginger scallion sauce similar to the one you'd usually have with Hainan chicken.Creamy Avo Tofu- Indeed very creamy, avocado puree/sauce at the base, a wasabi-like sauce at the top, decent if you like tofu in a mushy formMentai fried rice- My second favorite thing here. The roe in this rice were like little umami bubbles and each spoonful it would burst onto my tastebuds. I could probably eat 2 to 3 bowls of this. At the bottom is scorched crispy rice as well.","35 W 35th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-09,2023-09-16,Hakata Tonton,"Great service and delicious food!Shake shake noodles (aka cold sesame noodle) is tasty and balanced.Beef wrap was good and not dry.Chicken karaage was crispy on the outside and juicy inside.The pork skewers had good flavor, but was definitely on the fattier side as you'd expect of pork belly. Wish it was a little but crispier in texture.And make sure you leave room for the dessert platter! Everything was really good, and my personal favorite is the pudding/ flan. Yum!","35 W 35th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-09,2023-09-16,Hakata Tonton,"The food is excellent. I like the appetizers, especially the fried chicken and the fried avocados.  The sushi is fresh and made with care.  Our server was polite and helpful, just what was needed on a Friday night.","35 W 35th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Hakata Tonton,"We arrived on a Sunday just as they opened up without a reservation and got seated immediately.We ordered one small Motsu Hot Pot (white) and a Hakata Roll for two people. The servers provide two small dipping dishes for soy sauce and hot yuzu sauce, and prepare the dish for you until it is ready to consume. The chicken bonito broth is rich and flavorful, while the beef intestines are delightfully chewy and tasty. I was tempted to get a side of rice to finish the broth at the end.The Hakata Roll (amberjack, scallion, shiso, spicy cod roe) was good too, but I must say that the hot pot stole the spotlight!The lively but casual ambiance was accentuated by its clean and modern design. I would definitely dine here again!","35 W 35th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-08-25,2023-09-16,Hakata Tonton,"Ate here for the first time earlier this week and the food was fresh and tasty! I really enjoyed how we were served a cup of tea at the end of the meal - it really added to the experience. My only suggestion would be to have the servers wear gloves when serving the shake ramen; the person who served my ramen had his hands touching the rim of the glass the ramen was in a few times while dishing it onto my plate, so that unsettled me a little bit.","35 W 35th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-08-23,2023-09-16,Hakata Tonton,"I reckon this spot falls within the range of $$ to $$$. It's not pricey, as they offer simple dishes for order; however, it's also on the expensive side due to the uncomplicated yet flavorful food and moderate portions--you can stick to ordering just one item.I must clarify, though, that by calling the food 'simple,' I don't imply it's subpar. The flavors are splendid, accompanied by a satisfying afterkick that leaves you yearning for more. The dishes comprise basic, natural ingredients blended harmoniously--a concept reminiscent of a Japanese hotpot if you've ever experienced one.Although not obligatory, the waiter is happy to blend the meal for you. Perhaps my familiarity with the brisk pace of New York's dining scene made me slightly uneasy when someone offered to mix the food. The waiter is exceptionally amiable.It seems this gem remains obscure to most, enabling us to secure a table sans reservation. I genuinely wish this place stays undiscovered, granting me the opportunity to return without enduring a lengthy wait in line.","35 W 35th St New York, NY 10001"

2023-08-06,2023-09-16,Hakata Tonton,Really enjoyed dinner here! It's a very calm vibe and the servers are friendly. Appreciated that the music was at a low volume so we could actually have a conversation.The menu has a ton of really creative Korean fusion dishes. We had the shoju cocktails (strawberry and kiwi) which were nice and light. The highlight was the gnocchi with spicy cod roe sauce - such an unexpected mix of flavors but it was delicious! We also had the hamachi - great fish and miso sauce. Then we had the shishito peppers and Brussels sprouts and miso cod - also both quite good.,"35 W 35th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-07-30,2023-09-16,Hakata Tonton,"Hit up this place and the menu was packed with dishes that made our mouths water. Seriously, we had a hard time choosing.The food? It was alright, nothing to write home about. We ordered the hotpot with intestines and let's just say it was more fat than flavor. Got kinda tiresome halfway through.And about the bill, prepare your wallet, it's a bit on the pricier side.","35 W 35th St New York, NY 10001"
2023-04-30,2023-09-16,Hakata Tonton,"The menu looks pretty cool with so many dishes that we couldn't choose from. The food was okay though, intestines in the hotpot were too fatty made us bored half dish.","35 W 35th St New York, NY 10001"

2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Taiwan Pork Chop House,"The food here was so good! I ordered the Pork Chop over Rice. The pork chop was seasoned really well, and although it was thin, it still somehow managed to be so juicy. The pickled vegetables that it came with added a tang to the meal that really cut through the heaviness of the pork chop and rice. The portion was also much bigger than I thought -- I could have made it two meals if I wanted to. I also got to try some of their Taiwanese ice. I love how they have a selection of toppings for you to choose from. I felt like the ice was also a really big portion, considering it was only $6. They also still have outdoor seating, which is a plus. Overall, I would highly recommend! Just remember to bring cash since this establishment is cash-only.","3 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"
2023-09-02,2023-09-16,Taiwan Pork Chop House,Pretty standard fair at affordable prices. The pork was nicely flavored but was a bit overkill on the baking soda. Otherwise very affordable and consistent.,"3 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"

2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Taiwan Pork Chop House,"I came here recently, because I need a change from my go-to place.I was craving shaved ice and unlike Houston, there aren't that many places that serves shaved ice as a stand alone business.I don't want mochi, I don't want flavoured ice with matcha or strawberry. All I want is red bean with condensed milk and I remembered this place serving it in their lovely styrofoam, so I came here to get my fix.I wanted to satisfy my craving, so I ordered the spicy wonton and wonton soup to go and the shaved ice to stay.While I was waiting for my shaved ice, I noticed they got rid of all their styrofoam, but now they just serve everything in single use plastic. It doesn't matter if you're not taking it to go, but everything under the sun will be served in plastic.I am not a fan of this, because I like real plates and utensils. Plastic ware doesn't cut it and you try cutting something with the plastic knives...not very efficient.You know it is bad that they are serving piping hot food in plastic container and yes, this is an issue if you're taking things to go, but I try to minimize this on how frequently I do to go orders.I don't want to eat chemicals!I don't get this place, do they not understand how bad it is to just use all these single use plastic and throw them away? Our earth is over polluted with plastic and yet, this establishment doesn't seem to GAF.Anyways, the shaved ice is just ice not the milky shaved ice and you can tell they don't have the high powered shaver, since you still get chunks of big ice rather than extra-fine.However, it did it for me.I went home and opened up my to-go orders and noticed the wonton soup now looks completely different now. It came in a bigger plastic container with loads of napa cabbage and pickled vegetables and overcooked wonton.All the wrappers were deteriorated and just floating around in pieces and then I noticed something strange in there.It is sliced beef, you know the kind you use for hot pot wrapped inside the wonton. There is nothing else besides the cooked slice beef. Absolutely no fillings other than that sliced piece.WTFComplete fail. Not sure what happened here, did they run out of fillings and they just improvised?My spicy wonton also tasted weird. I have always ordered spicy wonton, so not sure if they gave me something else, because I noticed there are two versions of the spicy wonton on the menu. One that says Spicy wonton and one that says Pork and Vegetables Spicy wonton. I am not sure if this is a new thing, but I definitely never ordered anything other than spicy wonton, but it definitely didn't taste like how it tasted before.I can't do this place anymore, because it really pains me to see how much plastic they throw and they have a ""recycle"" and trash bin, but I am sorry, none of these plastics that they are using are recyclable.Who are they fooling - it is not being recycled.","3 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"
2021-03-03,2023-09-16,Taiwan Pork Chop House,"I could have sworn I reviewed this place, but let's see I am a fan of their spicy wonton and their regular wonton in general.It's really flavourful, so definitely good place to check out.I didn't give this place 5 stars because I wish they stop using so much Styrofoam and also one-time use plastic.Maybe they don't have the man-power to do the dishes, but I think we can all agree to suck it up and lets be more mindful of our planet.This place isn't great in terms of atmosphere, but the food is good, so I am down for a hole in the wall moment.In the summer time, I like to come here for the shaved ice, since they actually serve into you in a bowl rather than in cup like some places I've been to and yup, styrofoam.I recently came here for pick up and they have outdoor covered space and inside they're socially distance with the table spaces.","3 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"

2023-08-27,2023-09-16,Taiwan Pork Chop House,"Cheap consistent Chinatown eats. Solid 3.5, i hope yelp catches on and gives us more accurate rating markers, sometime soon.  (Hint hint) The pork chop over rice, salt and pepper chicken, chicken leg over rice, you really can't make a wrong choice selecting one of these. No frills, limited communication at times, but good food each and every time, for under $10. An extra pork chop will set you back an extra $3.00 which definitely isn't breaking the bank, but about the price of a ride on the subway. The staff is friendly and will offer you a menu book with pictures if there is a language barrier. The soft drinks available are very limited and if you aren't a soda drinker they have water and hot tea. Bring your own beverage if you are picky. Quick lunch but they do stay crowded both inside and outdoor eating, so plan accordingly.","3 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"
2023-08-19,2023-09-16,Taiwan Pork Chop House,Had the pork chop over rice and chicken thigh. Pork chop was not overly cooked. Just the right chew.

2023-08-10,2023-09-16,Taiwan Pork Chop House,"Taiwan Pork Chop House is a triumphant ode to the vibrancy and diversity of Taiwanese cuisine. Anchored by its signature dish, this humble establishment transforms everyday ingredients into a remarkable gastronomic experience.The Pork Chop Over Rice is an emblematic example of culinary artistry. The pork chop, perfectly seasoned and crisply fried to golden perfection, sits regally atop a bed of steamed rice. The meat's succulence combined with its crispy exterior creates a symphony of textures, making it an irresistible centerpiece to any meal.The Taiwanese Sausage is another shining star, a celebration of the island's traditional flavors, expertly married in a casing that bursts with savory-sweet delight with every bite. It's a taste that lingers, a memory that continues to tantalize long after the meal has ended.A soul-soothing offering is the Sour Cabbage Soup, a testament to the power of simplicity. The tartness of the cabbage, balanced with the savory depth of the broth, delivers a comforting embrace that leaves the soul refreshed and the palate invigorated.The Sub Gum Noodles is an intricate tapestry of textures and flavors, an exciting mélange of ingredients harmoniously bound by thin strands of perfectly cooked noodles. The Crispy Salt and Pepper Chicken adds a dash of vivacity, its perfectly seasoned, crunchy exterior housing moist, flavorful meat.The Wontons in Spicy Oil are a fiery delight, their delicate wrappers encasing a burst of savory filling, swimming in a spicy, richly flavored oil that leaves a gentle heat lingering on your tongue.For dessert, the Taiwanese Ice, adorned with Taro Balls and Herbal Jelly, offers a sweet, refreshing finish. The play of textures, from the chewy taro balls to the jiggly herbal jelly, against the backdrop of the shaved ice, is an endearing symphony of contrasting sensations.A visit to Taiwan Pork Chop House is akin to a gastronomic journey through the heart of Taiwan. It's a true testament to the island's rich culinary traditions, each dish served with a generous side of warmth and hospitality.","3 Doyers St New York, NY 10013"

We got two appetizers: ricotta toast & baby artichokes. Both were good! The flavors of the baby artichokes were delicious and made the artichokes stand out & the ricotta was creamy and cold which was a lovely touch. We got three pastas: sheep milk lemon occhi, spinach mascarpone and Pomodoro rigatoni. My favorite was the spinach mascarpone both the lemon & rigatoni were good but wouldn't necessarily say memorable. I'd definitely come back for the spinach mascarpone tho, very special dish.","329 Kent Ave Brooklyn, NY 11249"
2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Misi,"i like misi. i do. it delivers on its promises of fresh pasta and has somehow become my go-to place to take friends visiting from out of town. that being said, similar to lilia, I don't think anything is mindblowing. If anything, I've always been a bit underwhelmed by each dish. Besides the pistachio gelato, I also don't think anything is craveable. Not pictured but I think the infamous ricotta toast has too much ricotta on it, to the point of overkill. The pricing is fairly standard for new york and the ambiance is just lovely but I wouldn't hassle for the resy.","329 Kent Ave Brooklyn, NY 11249"

Definitely prefer the counter space and being able to watch the cooks do their thing. We ordered the ricotta toast (duh!) with a side of mushrooms. It was incredible! The mushrooms were perfectly cook and seasoned. I also got the sheep's milk ricotta occhi and the lamb pasta. The sheep's milk pasta was so delicate. It was an elevated version of a kid ordering buttered noodles...and that's not a bad thing. The simplicity, nostalgia, and flavors of the dish all make it a must try. The lamb pasta was a great little meat addition to our meal. Equally lovely and flavorful. I can't forget the cocktails! Incredible, definitely try the whiskey sour","329 Kent Ave Brooklyn, NY 11249"

Enjoyed an early lunch and had good service from Raymond and delicious food!  Perhaps that's the key.Started with a crostini appetizer with fresh roccota and seared red peppers. And since we had 4 people...enjoyed a selection of pastas to share. Tried their tortellini, occhi, spaghetti and corzetti. All perfectly cooked and prepared. The only hiccup was the serving of our coffees. The server came and then left and then came back with lukewarm espresso and cappuccinos. Didn't understand the delay.A definite place to go with friends so you can try a selection of appetizers and pastas.","329 Kent Ave Brooklyn, NY 11249"
2023-09-05,2023-09-16,Misi,Highly Overrated.Pretentious.The only reason this place isn't getting a one star is because of the interior.,"329 Kent Ave Brooklyn, NY 11249"
2023-08-30,2023-09-16,Misi,"I'm famously ostracized in my social circles for not thinking Lilia is all that (see: my Yelp review), so when I was brought to Misi--let's just say, I had low hopes.Fine. I'll eat my skepticism. So long as it comes with those delicious Grilled Romano Beans, which were perfectly charred and seasoned for my vegetable-loving heart.The Sheep's Milk Ricotta was solid but forgettable, but the Corzetti was gorgeous to behold and just as good to eat. Between the Linguine and the Chitarra, I preferred the Chitarra for its heartiness, but you honestly couldn't go wrong with either.Bonus points for not being a cacophonous cesspool of sound like Lilia. While Misi's decor also leans toward airy and spacious, it doesn't have the mile-high ceilings that make Lilia such an acoustic nightmare.More bonus points for providing much larger portions than Lilia.Also--and I know Misi can't actually help this--more bonus points for not having anywhere near the snooty, WASPy clientele that Lilia seems to attract. A nicer hostess too.BUT, I knocked off a star for service timing: It was going well until our second set of pastas, at which point a large private event began and caused a big bottleneck in the kitchen.","329 Kent Ave Brooklyn, NY 11249"
2023-08-21,2023-09-16,Misi,"I had a fantastic dinner at Misi last weekend. The drinks were refreshing, especially the Bellini Fizz. The whipped ricotta crostini appetizer was great, and I really enjoyed the grilled peppers.For the main course, the sheep's milk ricotta occhi and gnocchi sardi were both fantastic. For dessert, we shared the olive oil gelato. The flavor was so unique with slight hints of olive oil, and the texture was perfectly creamy.The service was great throughout my dinner as well. Our waitress was very knowledgeable with her recommendations.","329 Kent Ave Brooklyn, NY 11249"

The space is widespread and beautiful, the service is kind/attentive, and the food from Chef Missy Robbins is pretty great.-The ricotta crostini is a must, and is served with red peppers and smashed garlic.-The tomatoes are seasonal, I'm told, and were delicious, but at $21 I would probably pass.- The sheep's milk occhi was my favorite! The tortellini and fettuccine were also great, but far too salty for my liking.- Get the house made gelato. They had eight flavors, we loved the espresso one. The pistachio one was fine.- I had a glass of the Dolcetto. Wish I would've went for a Negroni.Misi is great to try, but i find myself preferring Lilia.-","329 Kent Ave Brooklyn, NY 11249"

Highly recommend the ricotta toast (pairs so well with the mushrooms), sheep's milk occhi with bottarga and lemon (great seafood flavor), and spinach and mascarpone tortelli. For cocktails, the A&T spritz is a more refreshing and citrus-y take on the traditional aperol spritz.Service is very friendly and knowledgeable, and the ambience is airy and upbeat.","329 Kent Ave Brooklyn, NY 11249"

Got coconut rice to pair with the dishes and it paired perfectly. The sweetness from the coconut really compliments the savoriness of the dishes. The dishes are on the smaller end and are meant for family style, which makes it easy to try more dishes across the menu. My favorite dish was the Khao Soi and I would really recommend trying it. Would come back again!!","68 Clinton St New York, NY 10002"

Sadly didn't get many pictures but still wanted to share!For starters, I really enjoyed my mocktail Pineapple Mustache - I was worried it would be overly sweet and more coconut leaning like a Piñacolada but it actually more sour and very refreshing, perfect to cool down from the humidity!1) Green Papaya Salad - very flavorful, would recommend2) Sizzling Sisig - comes on a sizzling platter with an egg yolk to be cooked/scrambled with the pork; found it a bit salty for my taste but great with rice3) Sinigang Shrimp - smaller shrimp than anticipated, but loved the fried okra served alongside4) Khao Soi - made with peanut oil for anyone with allergies! I liked the added crunchy noodles for texture5) Chili Pan Mee - one of my favorites of the night! The ragu tomato sauce was interesting at first but actually made the dish less heavy!6) Whole Fried Fish - a bit disappointed that this came out the last, after we were all full from our smaller plates.7) Bellychon - delicious! Comes with a little DIY of sauces and garnishes.8) Crispy Cauliflower - would pass; felt like overcooked cauliflower with too pungent and spicy of a sauce that did not complement as well.9) Fried Brussels10) Charred Long Beans11) Halo Halo - would highly recommend!

It is nice that it was on a sizzling pan to give it the smokinessService was not that great - it seemed rushed and at one point my friend got a passive aggressive response to get her water filled.

The sisig was crispy and had a kick of spice that was paired well with the coconut rice. We've had better Khao Soi elsewhere as the portion size was on the smaller end with little soup and noodles. The duck rice was crispy and decadent.","68 Clinton St New York, NY 10002"

I chose the Roasted Garlic Babka, Short Rib Pappardelle, Brussels Sprouts, and the renowned Filetto Cacio e Pepe Raviolo, together with my companion. We were thrilled with our selections and everything was DELICIOUS. Drinks were OK, but they could have been better or more unique. I had the Tequila Granita, which was excellent. Ciao, mother was consumed by my pal. Unfortunately, we didn't have room for dessert. I'll reserve some space for later.Overall, very worth looking into.","10 Columbus Cir New York, NY 10019"
2023-09-13,2023-09-16,Bad Roman,"Some of our food was very good, but other items were just okay. Our waiter was very professional, but somewhat rushed and overall the service was not up to the standard of a higher end restaurant. The atmosphere is nice, but a little like a mass market chain. I'm glad I went, because I've heard so much about this restaurant, but I have no reason to go back.","10 Columbus Cir New York, NY 10019"
2023-08-08,2023-09-16,Bad Roman,"The food was good, not great. Our service was very good. All in all, Bad Roman did not meet the hype. The garlic babka and the lemon cheesecake dessert were excellent. Caesar salad was good. I have had much better pasta. It really was below average. The tuna appetizer was also below average. The cocktail looked pretty, but again was average in taste. Atmosphere was nice, but nothing special.","10 Columbus Cir New York, NY 10019"

2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Bad Roman,"Overrated as the food is mediocre in taste and flavor. Additionally, the menu is not that exciting. The prices are decent considering all the NYC buzz, celebrity sightings, and strategic location. Nevertheless, I was underwhelmed.  Goes to show you: movie stars and famous people are not markers for taste.","10 Columbus Cir New York, NY 10019"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Bad Roman,"Bad Roman is an amazing experience everytime that I go. It is located inside the mall at Columbus Circle which puts it in a great location to meet up with a group of friends who are coming from different parts of the city. Once you get to the third floor, you cannot miss the restaurant as the entrance has a large neon sign (which in this case is not tacky lol). When you open the large wooden doors, you are greeted by several hosts who are friendly and quick. The décor is full of oranges and greens which give it a dim yet funky vibe. A nice thing about this restaurant is that they have quite a bit of seating at the bar that is first come, first serve, including high top tables around the bar area. All of the staff is extremely helpful and efficient.Right with the décor, the food and drinks are the stars of the show here. I always come for the pasta when I come and each dish is better than the last. The appetizers are also incredibly delicious so I would recommend not skipping out on them.","10 Columbus Cir New York, NY 10019"
2023-09-09,2023-09-16,Bad Roman,"Service wasn't professional at all. It was so hard to find our waiter to order the second round of drinks.Main course came out while having our appetizers even tho we specify we would like the main after. They took the main course back in the kitchen and brought it back cold half an hour later.Not, going back.","10 Columbus Cir New York, NY 10019"
2023-09-09,2023-09-16,5ive Spice,"Came for dinner and had a nice meal, but I would recommend lunch instead as the lunch menu has way more options than the dinner menu (banh mi, vermicelli bowls etc).The inside feels like an upscale bar and is quite dark. The service is fast and friendly and our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the boneless short rib tacos (entree) and summer rolls with shrimp (appetizer) as starters. The tacos were very good and I would order them again (3 per order so unsure how that is big enough for an entree, but maybe if you aren't that hungry?). The summer rolls were good as was the peanut sauce they came with, similar to ones we have had elsewhere.For entrees we tried the 5ive special pho and bun bo hue. The meat in the special pho was great, very tender and flavorful (though we were not fans of the meatball due to its texture, almost rubbery). The best meat was the short rib, though the thinly sliced angus was superb too. I liked the thicker noodles of the bun bo hue, but overall the special pho was better (the pork patty in the bun bo hue was not my cup of tea in terms of texture/flavor).The prices are as expected and the food is solid, I just wish they had the same menu for lunch and dinner.","363 3rd Ave New York, NY 10016"
2023-09-04,2023-09-16,5ive Spice,"I don't think I have ever had pho in New York. This place was worth a try.The 5ive Spice pho is the way to go. The $21 price tag is worth it. If you check in on Yelp, you can get a free appetizer. We got the green mango salad, and I regretted it. We should have gotten spring rolls.The pho menu does not have any tripe!","363 3rd Ave New York, NY 10016"
2023-09-02,2023-09-16,5ive Spice,"The staff is really friendly and helpful. They are like noticing everything you need in no time. The pho is a little bit too sweet for me, but the ceviche we got is pretty good.","363 3rd Ave New York, NY 10016"
2023-08-27,2023-09-16,5ive Spice,"This is a great pho addition to the neighborhood. It's not the best I've ever had, but it hits the spot. I really enjoy their chicken wings and combination pho but I do find their menu to be extremely overpriced. The bowls come with a bunch of meat, but I do find the broth to be a bit lacking and the noodles to be a little too soft. Otherwise, a solid addition to the neighborhood and a place I would return to when I don't want to travel far.","363 3rd Ave New York, NY 10016"

2023-08-17,2023-09-16,5ive Spice,"This location of 5ive Spice recently opened up in Kips Bay. They're definitely trying to go for a nightclub vibe based on the decor and all the instagram ads I get for their ticketed happy hour (?) events.I stopped by to try the banh mi a few times. It's fine, though it's hard to mess up this dish. I did think the David dip banh mi was a little bland because there's a thick slab of plain fried fish diluting most of the flavor. The dip didn't really do much to save this sandwich.They have different lunch, dinner, and take out menus. I was disappointed to see a lot of my favorites taken off the dinner menu. They also only take the yelp check in offer for lunch.","363 3rd Ave New York, NY 10016"
2023-08-16,2023-09-16,5ive Spice,"I really love this elevated take on Vietnamese food. Their appetizers were all so so good, we got to try the Banh Khot and Tuna Poke Tacos. These were both so so good! Perfect appetizers to pair with drinks. We also got the shaking beef and pork belly as entrees. My only complaint was that they were both a little salty but paired with rice it was ok. I do wish there was another flavor (sweet, sour, spicy, etc) to balance it out better.  Overall gorgeous plating and pretty good food all around. The interior has a really cool vibe. I would definitely try their pho next time as well!","363 3rd Ave New York, NY 10016"
2023-08-15,2023-09-16,5ive Spice,"Absolutely love this spot! Came twice: once for their lunch, and once for dinner. Both times, the restaurant wasn't very crowded and was able to seat us immediately.If you've been to their Soho location, the lunch menu seems pretty similar! They offer a variety of banh mi's, pho and banh xeo tacos. Got the banh mi and loved the flavors!The most recent time, I went for dinner and was surprised that they had an entirely new dinner menu. The menu is seasonal, and this time around, I tried the 5spice pho (which was AMAZING) and was loaded with meat. Also tried the Thit Kho Tau, which was pretty tasty. Get the spring rolls!","363 3rd Ave New York, NY 10016"
2023-08-11,2023-09-16,5ive Spice,"I really wanted to like this place, but sadly it was a solid disappointment.We made a reservation for 9.30pm after a movie on a Friday night, there wasn't a single other guest dining in.We were recommended to go with the pre fix (60 dollars, 4 course) but we decided to go with 2 apps (wings and shrimp cups) and 2 entres (taco and pho) instead.The shrimp came 15 mins after we ordered (the cups were still raw dough).The wings came 30 mins after the shrimp (after we repeatedly asked where it was)That was the end of all the food we received, because even after asking for the entrees repeatedly, even though there was only 1 other table occupied, even tho we only ordered tacos (?!) and pho (?!), one hour and 45 minute into our meal, still no food came out.In the end we were too hungry to wait any more and just decided to leave. We stopped at the entrance to settle up our checks but even that was an issue, somehow they could not produce the check?! Ultimately it took so long that they also gave up and decided to ""comp"" the apps...Bruh, a HARD PASS. I'm still hungry. NOPE.","363 3rd Ave New York, NY 10016"

Now 5ive Spice opened.When I entered at around 3:30 pm, the place was empty as it was past the lunch peak. I order right at the entrance of the place. While waiting for my food, I saw a bartender preparing for the evening.There was pop music playing in the background. By the time my order was ready, a party of three entered.

I got the potato burrito which was filled with vibrant yellow eggs, crispy flavorful potatoes, and green chiles. It was so simple and just so so good - no sauce needed to add flavor. It is good just the way it is. It was also so easy - you order up at the window and the immediately handed me my burrito. Tortillas are homemade which just makes this breakfast burrito levels above others in NYC.","178 N 8th St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

It's a shame she is so unpleasant because apart from her the place really is fantastic. She's put us on waitlists with time estimates and hasn't followed up- leaving us waiting on a table for HOURS. Has given us attitude on multiple occasions when it's the shortcomings of reservations for not answering the phone.

Both apps were yum! Everything is made in house, including the chips which my friend raved about. We both ordered a taco salad with pork adovada. I'm a bit of a difficult customer as I am gluten and lactose free. However, the waiter was very accommodating. The portions were large and the food was delicious! I especially enjoyed the lime cumin vinaigrette, which was substituted for the green chile ranch.

2023-08-18,2023-09-16,IWak,"I find a few things laughable with this place, all the 5 star reviews make me scratch my head. I understand the fish is good I won't take away the fact of that. The price to the portions is crazy to me. The sashimi grande is everything but grande, I liked the selection of fish but I really don't see what I paid for. I would love for someone to order the miso mushroom soup and see what $6 gets you, I laughed when I saw it. I'm the last person to talk about money when it comes to food because I careless of the price, but the 74$ I spent didn't get me much. The $13 ""regular roll"" of yellowtail jalapeño, is a standard $8 roll anywhere. I wouldn't write home about it. Try the place for sure but not something I would probably have again.","340 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

2023-07-29,2023-09-16,IWak,"I had high expectations for IWak, having read many reviews and also having scoured the menu a handful of times. I ordered delivery which may have been my mistake since it's literally less than a five minute walk from where I live.I often just stick to rolls if it's not a sit down or omakase situation because it's just more reliable. I did the spicy salmon, california, and spicy shrimp crunchy something or other. I thought the vinegar rice on the rolls was well done. Something that's usually butchered. The insides of the rolls were what threw me off. None of the spicy stuff was actually spicy :/ It was hard to tell if the fish was fresh or not, but perhaps dining in and trying the nigiri or sashimi would be a better indicator.","340 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-07-17,2023-09-16,IWak,"I just stumbled upon this place while on a work trip from LA and let me just say, it was absolutely incredible. They have lots of great sushi options but I got the omakase, which is extremely reasonably priced for the top tier quality. Every single piece of fish had unique flavor that shined and no fishy taste what so ever, even with the uni which tends to be too fishy for me but theirs was perfection. If you are looking for your new omakase go-to spot, this is 100% it.Service was fantastic as well and everyone in the restaurant is extremely nice and they have great hospitality. Cannot recommend enough.","340 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

Not cheap, not outlandishly expensive....just right for a night of fine dining.  Dinner for five, including three drinks and one bottle of wine was $ 400 before tax and tip....and excellent value.  We would go back again in a second...especially if we had that outdoor seating.","385 9th Ave Ste 85 New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-04,2023-09-16,Zou Zou’s,"4.5/5 Come for the food, stay for the vibe.Overall, the experience was exceptional. Especially the service, the deco and the vibe. Food wise, some good, some can be improved.I have long been wanting to try Zou Zou's. But it requires a lot of planning ahead. Last week, when the moon and stars were finally aligned , me and two of my best friends finally scored a table at this famed restaurant.On entering, I was transported from NYC to one of the  hustle bustle marketplaces in Morocco - the atmosphere and interior design reminded me of the Mamounia Hotel in Marrakesh.We were sit promptly even tho I was half hr late..extra half point!We picked out a few dipping and two mains to share. It was a mix of land-and-sea. I was in charge of wine pairing and although I had my picks in mind, asking the sommelier for a second opinion def boosted my confidence and making the right choice. .Now, food! Highly recommend trying any dipping that sound good to you.Appetizer/mezze. We had the green tahini, roasted eggplant and chickpea. I love them all but the whipped-cream like green tahini was def my favorite and you won't find it elsewhere in NYC. The black garlic added extra umami to the otherwise good but not great hummus. The eggplant dipping was a bit watery, unfortunately. If you wanna cut carbs, get them with crudites instead of bread ;)The hamachi ceviche from the Raw menu was a disappointment. I def have better elsewhere. Prob won't order again.Mains. We got the lobster kebab and the baby lamb chops.The lobster was ok. Honestly, I don't think delicate seafood should be cooked on flame. And it weren't much to share with; a few chunks of lobster meat. The fennel, served as an accompanied component, was actually more interesting, IMO. I might try cooking fennel this way at home :)The baby lamb chop was quite good but def have room to improve. I would prefer the fat to be trimmed out more. Otherwise, tender and juicy. The dressing was the actual star here - smoked cherry with a mixed of spice (I am guessing cumin, coriander, cinnamon?) . Reminding me of lamb tangine but instead of apricot or raisin, they use smoked cherry here. It was rart, sweet and perfumed. We loved it so much that we asked for some warm and fluffy pita bread to soak it up after the lamb was gone!Dessert. Friend's choice; I just went with double espresso. Frozen lemon yogurt with olive oil. Surprisingly good- savory and not too sweet. If you are a dessert person, def go for it.All in all, I enjoy the whole experience here. I could not thank the staff here enough for the hospitality. So much so that me and my friends decided to make Zou Zou a regular meet-up spot so we can check out the rest of the menu.Extra bonus points.- By 8 pm, the light started to dim, music switching to lounge, soft electronics. Perfect for an intimate date.- Extensive, well curated wine list to go with any choices of food. Price is reasonable too- Pay attention to the wine glass , it was very elegant. For restaurants of this calibre, I judge every detail :)","385 9th Ave Ste 85 New York, NY 10001"

I had the vodka drink. It was 90% ice. The rest of the cocktails did not look great. The only reason for 3 stars as opposed to 2 was that the oysters are fabulous.

2023-08-22,2023-09-16,Zou Zou’s,"Booked Zou Zou's for a bday dinner. The ambience there was great - like all the other restos owned by the Quality group.Ordered:1. The dip sampler: this was phenomenal. The pita was nice and fluffy. The green tahini dip was a stunner - herby and very zingy. The whipped ricotta with apricots was also great. I'm a sucker for anything with saffron and it blended beautifully with the creaminess of the ricotta and the apricots. The eggplant dip was also pretty good.2. Salad: such a great salad with the crispy bits with zaatar and the charred grapes on top. A bit too salty for all of us but balances a bit when you eat it with grapes. Salt levels could be lower imo3. Chicken: the chicken itself was alright, pretty good and not dry. The stunner was the buttermilk sauce though. I could drink this stuff. Good stuff.4. Lobster kebab: also pretty good especially with the cherry tomato sauce.All the dishes were pretty good and would definitely come back to Zou Zou's. Only gripe is that their dessert menu isn't the best selection and would have loved to see something more chocolate-y for those who prefer those types of desserts. Ended up not having dessert there since we were in the mood for something else.They weirdly also do not comp anything for birthdays. Quality Italian does so a bit of a disappointment. The only thing they offer is for you to order a dessert and for them to decorate it and stick a candle on it. Given the lackluster dessert selection, a bit of a letdown. For a place that's so nice and on the pricier end; I would have expected so much more.","385 9th Ave Ste 85 New York, NY 10001"

If so, the goose had already flown back to Canada. Served in a small metal cup. Let me stress the ""small"". Ridiculous. And it cost $19! Go elsewhere.","385 9th Ave Ste 85 New York, NY 10001"
2023-08-21,2023-09-16,Zou Zou’s,Really tasty food in a fun setting. Business lunch meetings work here but so do long meetups with wine. Lots of options for picky eaters but it's all good.,"385 9th Ave Ste 85 New York, NY 10001"
2023-08-20,2023-09-16,Zou Zou’s,I just came for drinks but I'll be back to try out some food - it looked delicious. The place is definitely very hip/posh but it's an interesting mix of people. I was there on a Friday after work/early dinner hours and the bar wasn't too busy so it was easy enough to walk in and sit there (as 2 people).,"385 9th Ave Ste 85 New York, NY 10001"
2023-08-20,2023-09-16,Zou Zou’s,"First of all, I would say the service is completely a miss at the price point for this restaurant. And from the limited menu I was able to select from the food was so mediocre and tasteless I had to ask the server if it came out of a jar! I have dined at many Michelin restaurants and fine dining establishments all over the world particularly NYC- and between the service and the food and the price tag this felt like a fake plastic tourist trap.Bottomline: Just don't do it!The why:I had positive expectations hence reserved this for a relaxing evening of delicious food and convenience since I was staying at a HY hotel. Sadly I ended the night trying to wash out the after taste and sloppy service with some sparkling water+ Turkish delight I bought earlier in the day from one of my favorite Jewish delis.I have food allergies so when I called a few hours ahead asking the host if they can accommodate my allergies or dishes modified? I was told I'd have plenty of options to choose from/and she'll pass them on to the chef. I was pleasantly surprised and didn't think twice. I later regretted not making an alternate reservation elsewhere.Upon check in I asked the host again and she said I'm all set.My server who took a while to show was apparently not informed about my allergies and as soon as he found out seemed to have lost interest in us as guests as there was really nothing other than the dips and one salad + two dry mains without any sauce stripped bare they could offer me! Much of the food was prepped earlier and they couldn't even bother with any adaptation to like 85 percent of the menu so my dinner was effectively ruined. This was not ok because I called ahead and was reassured that Id have plenty of options. Most decent establishments would just be honest and let the customer go elsewhere!I only stayed after being given the surprise news because I was exhausted  + my guest just wanted to eat as we couldn't Stay out too late on a Sunday night since we are only on a hectic trip to nyc this time. I also resigned myself to manage with just the dips and crudités but boy was I wrong.It was probably the worst dip I've ever had But at 25 usd + 6 for bread it was gross. The whipped ricotta didn't seem whipped at all, combined with apricots turned it into lumpy cream pie dessert. The only semi ok dip was the hummus with black garlic and the most unpalatable one was the smoked carrot with pomegranate ( why the strong garlic chips) Im praying that the crudités were handled hygienically as that's mainly all I could really eat and that tasted fresh.If a restaurant can't even do the most basic dips with bread right what can they do?After the dips, made me completely nauseated and lose my appetite I felt it was a mixed blessing as I didn't waste any more money on this establishment. That said maybe the mains are better- our starters were so tasteless we couldn't even think of ordering the mains.It's like hating the teaser of a movie, why would anyone go watch the full length feature?In my defense I was willing to try an entree which was just grilled branzino without any sauce or accompaniment to my disappointment!The reason I passed was because the server couldn't even answer if this fish was fresh from the day or previously frozen. It's fairly common for a restaurant that's $$$ to know this basic info. I personally am picky about my seafood for both safety and taste reasons- the best chefs are too! The fact that the server was not knowledgeable about this and that the kitchen could not even modify a single dish AND even my guest's standard fare order ( he has no allergies) was bland and boring should let you the reader get why I'm compelled to write this review.My guest's food was meh and consisted of the gem salad with grapes with their stems intact lacking any aesthetics plopped on some greens. The manti was also small even by appetizer standards and basically lacked flavor.We're just hoping the food is fresh and handled safely so no one gets food poisoningOn another note there was no finesse or charm of the server nor the outdoor space and felt like an insult to Mediterranean food if you could even call it that.If this meal cost 35 usd for 1 salad, a trio of dip and 4 tiny crispy dumplings + tasted like food cart food then I'd be ok with it- But for 80 USD plus tip it's obscenely bad food. If I wasn't starving quite frankly I would have thrown it in the trash.Instead I'd recommend Shuka, Miss ada and many of the Arab/Israeli/ Greek restaurants in nyc for decent meal that may not maim your taste buds.Zouzou's is what one calls a tourist trap and if their mains were the real star of the show then perhaps they can improve on their service and not try to trap a reservation based customer who they can't cater to!All I can say is try at your own risk!","385 9th Ave Ste 85 New York, NY 10001"

The menu does not list chilis on the dish (I checked afterwards). When the waiter brought it I said I hate chilis and he gaslit me by saying they are on the menu description for the item (they're not) and to just try the dish, I would like it. Then he walked away.

We went halfsies and enjoyed the savory and sweet signature dishes.

Both the garganelli and rigatoni pasta options are solid choices. Some locations also offer pizza, which I personally prefer over the pasta.While the food here won't particularly leave a lasting impression, the lively ambience and the convenience of easily securing a reservation makes Pecora Bianca a dependable option.","1133 Broadway New York, NY 10010"

However be prepared to wait for a bit as they're always slammed with orders during the AM. I've typically waited between 30 minutes to 1 hr. Do not fret, they're very organized and you can call ahead of time prior to leaving the house or take some time to go grocery shopping while you wait, you won't regret it!","88 Elizabeth St New York, NY 10013"

Like, ALWAYS wrong?!Well, if you are in the Chinatown area, make sure you go to Yi Ji Shi Mo Noodle Corp - this place is not one of those 'usual overhyped' places, and they will not disappoint!We were actually looking for another cheong fun cart (which ended up being super gross), and we saw that there was a small steady line in this carry-out place; there's a large menu stand outside, and, when you're ready, you take a few steps down into their space, and you order at the cashier - make sure you state what sauces/toppings you want on your cheong fun (peanut butter sauce, sweet sauce, hot sauce, and/or sesame seeds).We just ordered a #10, which was the Beef Rice Roll; this comes in a 'small' or a 'large', in which we opted for the small, with all 4 of the sauces/toppings.We were told it'd be about 10 minutes or so for our order, which was totally fine with us!OMG, these were literally the best cheong fun ever!  They are made to order, the rice roll was perfectly cooked - not under- or overdone!  The filling had plenty of beef bits, but their sauces/toppings were the perfect consistency and savoriness in the flavor, that it totally elevated this dish even more.I wished we had ordered 10 more of the 'large' sized ones!Staff here were friendly and efficient; not sure what others were complaining about in terms of service - maybe just know what to order before you stand in line and articulate when you speak?This place is cash only, so make sure you go to your bank/ATM beforehand.I can't wait to return to try their other fillings!+best cheong fun!+tasty sauces/toppings+friendly and efficient service","88 Elizabeth St New York, NY 10013"

I almost feel like I drank it. It was gone before I knew it.There are some small small small area in the store where you can stand and eat.

The blue moon tasted like something was wrong with the tap. We came starving as we all skipped breakfast and lunch. We ordered the nachos and we honestly only ate them because we were hungry. The cheese sauce tasted so cheap. For our meals, the chicken fingers tasted like and I quote ""cafeteria lunch"" and one was left over. The Philly cheesesteak needed to be downed in hot sauce to make it edible. The impossible sliders were dry and 2/3 were leftover. The Mac n cheese bites were oily but not bad. The fries were oily but not bad. The place was super loud and we were screaming to be heard. We wound up making an early night of it because it was not a good experience.

She was prompt in answering the many questions that I had, and informative with information even outside her responsibilities, such as local florist recommendations. She enthusiastically provided me with her personal cell number to make sure everything went smoothly with the surprise, and made sure the staff/managers knew everything I had discussed with her. The private room in the wine cellar is stunning, and an ideal place to to host an intimate event. And the food is absolutely delicious!

They're definitely known for their burger, which I'd give a 4/5. A little pricey imo, but very filling for sure. Not sure if it lived up to the hype, but still definitely pretty good! The pizza was outstanding as well, if I were to come back, I'd try more of their pizzas. We got their vodka pizza and wow, it was perfectly cooked, cheese was delicious, basil was fresh on top.Ambience was cute downstairs - a touch on the louder side, but not unbearably so.

The only critique i have is that I'm not a huge fan of pretzel buns but it works with this flavor monster!This was also my first time trying Detroit style pizza and I'm absolutely a fan! The Emily pizza was the star of the show for us! It had truffle cheese, pistachios, and sweet honey drizzled on top of the most fluffy crust! The other pie we got (the MVP) was also very tasty. I liked the combination of the red, vodka, and pesto sauces!The space is casual and cute, lots of windows and natural light.

2023-09-09,2023-09-16,WarrenPeace,"The interior is really quite beautiful. It was like being in someone's home with their collection of mix and match furniture. Unfortunately the overall experience is dampened by not having AC on a 90 degree day. The poor employees! They did have ceiling fans but again in a hot, dim, and muggy environment and with the noise of everyone around it was a sensory overload. It was difficult for our waiter to get to us once we were seated since it was next to a large crowd of standing tables.If you're going to try have dinner here, I'd only recommend the Bullseye - a rib eye with bone marrow butter and a sweet potato purée. The beef tongue bruschetta was no longer on the menu.The Bazaar Qofte - 4 black pieces of kabob that came with a pita and a pita were decently grilled but lacked any real seasoning.The tuna carpaccio seemed okay, beautifully presented but was really drowning in the oil and alfalfa.The Duck Fat Parm Garlic fries were thick cut in a unique shape but didn't really have much seasoning to them at all. There's barely any Parm Garlic much else any hints of duck fat.The crawfish appetizer seemed so intriguing in the menu but was again seasonless! Not even the sauce it was in had much flavor. The menu said it had gochuchang but it was far from being spicy - I asked for some salt and pepper which helped a teensy bit.At the end of the night, we heard the table next to us having some issues but couldn't really catch what was happening over the noise. Turns out their card reader was not working and we had to run to a bank, which was the icing on top of a mediocre experience.I was so looking forward to having a better experience but the execution in operations is so unfortunate.","77 Warren St New York, NY 10007"

2023-07-09,2023-09-16,WarrenPeace,"Impressed - We came across WarrenPeace at Taste of Tribeca - of course we ordered the lamb sliders which are delicious.  I found penne arrabiata to be the best I've had.  A friend had the steak, amazing!  My other friend raved abpit the crayfish.  Service was extremely attentive.  Booze selection was great though I stuck to my usual, others loved their cocktails.  Atmosphere impeccable.  Thank you, see you again!","77 Warren St New York, NY 10007"

2023-05-07,2023-09-16,WarrenPeace,A cool little place downtown.  We stopped in after visiting the Freedom Tower.  The place had a nice vibe to it.  The service was very good. Both friendly and professional.Everyone in our party enjoyed both their appetizer and meal.  The craft cocktails were delicious.,"77 Warren St New York, NY 10007"
2023-05-04,2023-09-16,WarrenPeace,"Had a great time here. The food was delicious!.I particularly enjoyed the duck fat fries and burger. I didn't try a drink but was told by the group I was with that the cocktails were similarly delicious. Add to that the beautiful decor and attentive service, WarrenPeace is a really special place. Looking forward to coming here again!","77 Warren St New York, NY 10007"
2023-03-20,2023-09-16,WarrenPeace,"My daughter and I recently ate at the bar.  It was honestly one of the best nights out in New York City we have had, and we will treasure the memory Warren Peace gave us.Lucas is not only a master mixologist, but he efficiently runs a busy bar making sure all patrons are served in a timely manner while ensuring you feel as if you are the only customer. He is good humored and his knowledge of wine and spirits is superlative. When we asked him to surprise us, he consistently came up with great drink's that paired perfectly with our food.Erdo is a master in the kitchen and an amazingly gracious host. He makes you feel like an honored guest in his home. He is attentive and the array of sharing plates that he and his team prepared was each better than the last. The perfect portion size meant that my daughter and I were able to sample loads of dishes. How does such food keep getting better throughout the entire night?Warren Peace is beautifully decorated with a really welcoming, warm, quality vibe. Although it was a busy night, it never felt overly crowded and we were made to feel special and valued. Combine that with such amazing food and the best team I have come across in New York and you have a five star, smash hit. I cannot speak highly enough.","77 Warren St New York, NY 10007"

2023-08-17,2023-09-16,Falansai,"Came for a dinner date on a Saturday before Company XIV. We got the crab noodles, beef skewers and the pork shoulders and it was all so good! The crab noodles had chunks of crab and was so tangy and tasty. The beef skewers came as 3 and was so good. Pork shoulders was probably my favorite dish which was surprising. My only negative star was the drinks. I don't think our waiter knew the wines super well. He was pushing for the pricer wines and gave us tangy wines when we specifically asked not to. It really isn't a huge deal and we should've definitely got glasses instead. The space was also a bit surprising. It was much barer than I expected for such an interesting space. Wish they did a bit more with it.","112 Harrison Pl Brooklyn, NY 11237"
2023-08-16,2023-09-16,Falansai,"What a gem in Brooklyn! Good food at a reasonable price. Go empty stomach cos they feed you like crazy.I have been following chef Eric's story for a while and have been eyeing this place. I finally made it! I expected good food but did not expect such amazing flavors tbhSo highly recommend the Dac Biet menu, which btw they don't offer if you are seated outsideI won't spoil the menu for you by writing each flavor. I went in blind and was pleasantlySurprised. It has an amazing variety of fish and meat combining both Asian and Mexican flavorsThink tacos, ceviche, tune friend rice, grilled fish all with a variety of their special sauces and pickled veggiesThere's one dish with an eggplant sauce that's simply out of the world.Just when you think you cannot eat anymore and there's nothing on the menu that couple top what you had so far, they bring out their dessert. It's a witty end to the meal. It's fresh from the coconut, texture from chia, and meatiness from jackfruitThey have wine pairings that are reasonably priced but if you have a small stomach I'd say save on the drinks and make way for the food.","112 Harrison Pl Brooklyn, NY 11237"
2023-08-13,2023-09-16,Falansai,"When you arrive at Falansai, you have the sensation you are eating at a friends house on a Thursday evening. The interior is simple, thoughtful, and the staff are welcoming but not overly eager. No frills, pleasant, and comfortable. We came here for an adventurous early Friday dinner (we are parents so early dinners are the jam right now). We were excited to try this fusion and Vietnamese and Mexican. We ordered the sake and a rose wine and decided on the Dac Biet tasting menu. My partner asked me if we should order a La carte, but I happen to enjoy going on the chefs journey. Dac Biet it is!See the photos for the dishes - it was a simple, filling, scatter plot of flavors. We were pleasantly full by the end, with enough desire left for dessert. The most striking pairing for me was the lemongrass sausage in the sambal sauce. The flavors went against each other nicely, and sort of woke up my brain. It was a pair I've never had before, so I feel like a new neural connection was made!Overall a lovely place to eat, and despite what other reviews say, you should do the Dac Biet your first time. We are pretty sure chef Eric Tran was glad to see us go on his journey that evening.","112 Harrison Pl Brooklyn, NY 11237"
2023-08-05,2023-09-16,Falansai,Food all so salty. Had to ask hot water so i have to put on dumpling soup but still salty. We ordered 6 menus and 2 didnt even touch because so salty. The Server guy was not nice. And not even ask any question why we left so much food. And when i ask hot water because its so salty. He didnt even say sorry that food is horrible. $180 bills without eating food,"112 Harrison Pl Brooklyn, NY 11237"
2023-08-03,2023-09-16,Falansai,"Hip, modern and delish.  The menu is packed with lots of exciting and delicious fusioned flairs.  Totally loved it.  Highly recommend the tuna tartare and the lamb neck and the portion is big.  The fried rice is very tasty and home dish like.  Menu changes so by the time you read this the lamb neck might be off the menu.  It shouldn't stop you dining here nonetheless.They have a beer garden in the back, and it is a great place to mingle and order light grubs.The End.","112 Harrison Pl Brooklyn, NY 11237"
2023-07-31,2023-09-16,Falansai,"I found a hair in the food, showed it to the server who didn't seemed bothered at all by it.I told the manger about it on my way out, He just said ""eew"", shrugged his shoulders and went on his way.I am very supportive of small establishments and  know how they have to struggle. I also understand that things just happen at times, but the response (or lack of it) was very concerning.Had to flag down the server multiple times just to get more water.No one came to check if we wanted anything else once the food was brought to the table.The green curry was very delicious, but did have that hair in it.....I guess to add more flavor, since they didn't seem at all bothered by it.Very disappointed and dissatisfied.","112 Harrison Pl Brooklyn, NY 11237"
2023-07-28,2023-09-16,Falansai,"Went for a friend's birthday party and did the Dac Biet tasting menu. The food was overall good and creative, the highlights were the skewers and the curry. The tamales were a bit flat for me. Felt like the food was a touch underseasoned but the litany of punchy sauces and pickles definitely made up for it. The private room in the back was a wonderful place to celebrate, and the wine list is exceptional.","112 Harrison Pl Brooklyn, NY 11237"

2023-06-02,2023-09-16,Falansai,"Honestly, living in NYC for the last two years and taking the opportunity to eat at as many of the most talked about restaurants I've ever been to, this restaurant gave me my first sensation in eating that gave me multiple meals in a several course meal that made me feel for the first time in my culinary eating experience that I've tasted food that I have literally not a single piece of feedback to improve the meal. It was perfect and bravo to the staff.But to the management of the establishment, I hope you can know that your waitstaff had the audacity to ask us if we wanted to tip more after providing a tip amount that we felt was right for the service provided. It was awful. They made our party feel weird, uninvited, and absolutely unappreciated and explained nothing about a flight of chef tasting that we didn't know that we were even eating. The difference in the quality of the staff of the kitchen and the waitstaff is so apparent that unfortunately even though this is the second time we've been, I don't want to go again. This was an absolutely incredible experience and shame on the management for allowing such terrible staff to represent the front office of the restaurant.Go and be prepared for the staff to be hipster Bushwick and sheik.","112 Harrison Pl Brooklyn, NY 11237"

2023-09-04,2023-09-16,Lava Shawarma,"After reading the reviews, we decided to give this place a try.We were immediately seated after checking in.We decided to share everything that night. We ordered Vegan Mix Grill Plate, which has 2pieces of falafel, cauliflower, eggplant, zucchini, side of Jerusalem salad, side of baba ghanouj, served with pita bread. Hubs thought that the vegan mix grill plate was pretty good. He liked the eggplant a lot. Daughter liked the baba ghanouj as well. She loved it so much that she had to stop herself from eating it all because we were sharing everything. LOL.We also ordered the Lamb & Beef Shawarma Plate, which has lamb and beef shawarma, Jerusalem salad, basmati rice, garlic sauce and homemade spicy sauce. Daughter liked this entree as well. She thought it was a perfect portion for herself. Hubs thought it was ok but he said that he had better elsewhere.I also ordered mint iced tea and was surprised that it was served in a 6 oz cup. I was expecting a larger cup, I guess.I was impressed with how clean the kitchen was and how efficient the chef was working in such a tiny kitchen.Service was quick. Will return to try other items on the menu.","226 Thompson St New York, NY 10012"

2023-08-21,2023-09-16,Lava Shawarma,A cute shawarma place with nice earthy decor inside. The shawarma wrap seems to be the most popular item here since a lot of other tables ordered it as well. It was good but not a lot of flavor- for the price though it's pretty worth it. If i come back id want to try the kebab meals as well.,"226 Thompson St New York, NY 10012"

Hummus is must try in the menu as well as their tea from palatine.,"226 Thompson St New York, NY 10012"
2023-06-27,2023-09-16,Lava Shawarma,"Really nice sit down option in Greenwich village that's open late and serves authentic middle eastern food! I really liked their Chicken Shawarma Arabic, the garlic sauce paired SO well with the meal. I would ask for extra sauce on the side next time I come here haha. The spicy falafel was also very good, it was crisp and very well seasoned. It's filled with spicy onions and it packs quite the kick, I just wish that it came with more than 2! Their hibiscus tea was also delicious, it had just the right amount of sweetness to it.Even though we went late, the servers were still very attentive and kind. The restaurant itself is quite spacious, something I find to be a rare feature especially around MacDougal/Thompson street. Lava Shawarma has an open kitchen concept too, you can see the meat roasting on the spit which I always love seeing. I think Lava Shawarma gives off a cozy homestyle vibe, there's pillows on some of the seats and is a really chill place to grab a quick bite or sit down and chat with friends.","226 Thompson St New York, NY 10012"
2023-06-01,2023-09-16,Lava Shawarma,"A friend and I decided to grab a quick dinner at Lava yesterday and were not disappointed. We both ordered two different types of rice bowls. I asked for a Shawarma bowl with both lamb and chicken. The chicken was seasoned well, and appropriately moist. The garlic sauce on top was quite strong and I can see why they use it sparingly. Great flavors though. The lamb on the other hand, I found a little bit on the dry side and chewy, which was not the best. The rice was flavorful and fragrant, with every grain separate. Salad was plentiful. I appreciated it. I do think for $15 The portion was on the smaller side. I have had similar Shawarma plates at other restaurants that comes with a lot more food.I was debating to get a hot drink and ordered the Arabic tea. The tea smelled and tasted Amazing, I loved the cloves and cinnamon and all the spices that were coming through and it wasn't super strong. I really enjoyed it. My friends biryani bowl had a boiled egg and chicken but it was a little watery? I'm not sure exactly what was going on there.Service was pretty standard, they had one guy at the cash register, who was also attending to all the tables. I do like the decor inside, they have various types of seating. I think they're most popular item is the Shawarma wrap, so if you go here, definitely stick to that. Overall a pretty solid place in the neighborhood.","226 Thompson St New York, NY 10012"

An establishment that will not allow changes to its flagship menu item must either be crazy or really know something that we all don't.  The first bite was followed by euphoric silence until the last bite.  Absolutely delicious and would definitely recommend to others.  The pizza looked pretty damn good too (I'm just not the biggest fan of Detroit style pizza, ya'll go off)!","35 Downing St New York, NY 10014"

2023-09-10,2023-09-16,OH BOY,"For my prior years living on Havemeyer Street, this was always my plan b coffee option when for whatever reason I didn't make it to one of my preferred spots. But now the fka Beck and Call has rebranded as Oh Boy, and Northerly Coffee has closed because its Turkish owner decided to relocate back to Türkiye after a decade on Havemeyer Street, and suddenly this modest cafe seems worth revisiting.I finally had a proper breakfast here in addition to just a coffee, and the egg and cheese on brioche with a hash brown added to the sandwich is everything you might seek in a hangover cure. I know their rip-off McGriddle has garnered more attention, but would you really trade in a luxurious brioche for flapjacks?Another sleeper hit is their watermelon lemonade, which tastes vaguely salted to me and is one of the most refreshing options on a hot summer day.","84 Havemeyer St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

No real sorry about it.I'm not sure what is going on with customer service these days but please say your open when you are.

Wish it was a little easier to eat as a sandwich but none the less was great. The pancake was a good amount of sweetness with syrup in it, I thought it needed a touch more of syrup inside the pancake batter though. The egg was so fluffy & bacon was the right amount of crispy. Service was great & friendly + the outdoor seating was great for a good weather day!","84 Havemeyer St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-08-08,2023-09-16,OH BOY,"Food was extremely overpriced. I ordered a sausage, egg, and cheese McGriddy and the sausage tasted like a hamburger. I definitely would not recommend this place.","84 Havemeyer St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

2023-08-03,2023-09-16,OH BOY,"This is a new place that is getting a lot of hype for their McGriddy sandwich which is a higher-quality play on McDonald's McGriddle. Having heard that they sell out of it super early, we got here a few minutes after they opened at 9AM and there was no line, they had all of their menu items in stock, and the few outdoor tables they had available were open. With that being said, the location is super small (probably because they are so new) so I would expect to wait anytime after 10AM on a weekend and it's probably easier to get takeout. The kitchen is also super small and seemed to only be making two orders at a time so our food didn't come out at the same time. That didn't bother us that much though considering how amazing the food was. The McGriddy was the real standout and so much better than anything you would get at McDonalds (pro-tip: order it with a hashbrown to add some texture). Our friend also got the breakfast burrito which he said was really good but didn't compare to the McGriddy. In terms of service, the people who worked here were so nice and helpful. We will definitely be back to try their burger and chicken sandwich and I would not be surprised if they move to a bigger location soon.","84 Havemeyer St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

I usually come for lunch, they know my fav dish on the lunch menu. I rarely order soup with lunch only because at 3.95 they only offer it with chicken. I'm a pescatarian--No meat. It's been bothering me that if I want soup with lunch, I have to pay the $8 dinner price for the vegetarian Tom Ka Pak. Today I asked the woman at the register why it's not on the lunch menu. She said because it's made with coconut milk and more expensive. More expensive than chicken??? Which makes me feel really good about not eating meat because if coconut milk is more expensive than chicken I don't even want to say to the meat eaters what I'm thinking!","4906 Vernon Blvd Long Island City, NY 11101"

2023-06-15,2023-09-16,Tuk Tuk,"Tuk Tuk is definitely one of my favourite restaurants in the area. It was one of the first restaurants I tried around here, and it's one that I consistently go back to. Their food is very good, and I mean VERY good. I've brought multiple people here (even an uncle with particularly high standards) and they've all agreed. Our favourites include pad kee mao, pad see ew, basil fried rice, and the green curry. They're all so, so good. I've also tried the mango sticky rice and the green papaya salad. Those I could take or leave, but the magic is in the entrees. The staff is also lovely, and there is ample space to sit. Every once in a while though, I'll call in for a pick-up order, and they'll tell me the order will be ready in 15-20 mins, but it will be ready in less time. They are so fast with the food. Speedy service and tasty food. What more could you ask for? I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves Thai food.","4906 Vernon Blvd Long Island City, NY 11101"

All his questions are illegal but we let it go but he was still pretty annoyed and upset that service dog was in the restaurant. If you are treating customer with discrimination it's not necessary to even try your food cause it can't be good. Food service business is all about how you make your customer feels. Who wants to feel like 2nd rated citizen. His attitude just made the restaurant not edible. Horrible experience,"4906 Vernon Blvd Long Island City, NY 11101"

He reluctantly sat us down in a corner. Then a minute later asks us to move to the back of the place so that customers don't feel uncomfortable. The minute we sat down, my dog only sat and laid down.

2023-08-25,2023-09-16,bōm,"Oh my god this was the best meal I've ever had in my life and blew the other fine dining experiences I've had in NYC out of the water. As you walk through the interior of Oiji Mi, there is a door in the back that leads to another beautifully designed room where counter seating for guests surrounds a chef preparation table in the center. Every few chairs there is also a counter grill where they prepare the meats. This was an EXPERIENCE partially thanks to the way the room and flow are designed.My bf and I came here for our anniversary today, not knowing what to expect because it's new and not that many reviews... but wow this was the most worth it tasting menu I've ever had. It had way more courses than similarly priced tasting menus at michelin star restaurants I've seen, all meat or seafood, and every single one was incredible.The entire experience was about 2.5 hours long and consisted of 15 courses. First half was dedicated to seafood, second half was meats. Personally I loved the first course (bluefin tuna) the most out of the seafood, but almost all the meat dishes were equally my favs. From the tenderloin to the wagyu galbi to the a4 kagoshima.... everything literally melted in my mouth and the flavors really came thru. There's also an optional fresh truffle add-on for the final meat course (dry aged ribeye) for an extra $50 pp, which we decided to try and it was def a very unique taste but I don't think it added much to the meal so I wouldn't get it again. Many of the courses also had mini korean inspired sides, like a version of kimchi or other pickled veggies, as a palate cleanser.After the meats, the final savory course was the hansang charim which is basically banchan with a special type of korean rice and some seaweed to make your own banchan wraps, as well as a short rib soup with daikon. It was the perfect dish to end on because comfort food - except the meat in the soup was literally wagyu, which I was not expecting, which is why it shook me to the core when it melted in my mouth.The blueberry dessert and chaemo (basically deconstructed melona) were great too, but my fav dessert was actually the buckwheat ""cake"" (idk what it's actually called) that was the anniversary surprise for us (not on the menu). The texture was sort of like cheesecake bc kinda dense but SO GOOD and not too sweet! I love buckwheat desserts in general and this was just exquisite.Of course, the service was top tier too. Everything was perfect, attention to detail was insane, and we were admiring all the cool designs (from dishware to furniture) the whole time. They also gave you a little gift bag at the end with a copy of that day's menu and a box of bonbons from the pastry team! The bonbons also had asian inspired flavors and were absolutely delicious. Simply wow I could not recommend another restaurant more for a very special occasion.","17 W 19th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-07-18,2023-09-16,bōm,"Tucked inside a hidden room of Ouji Mi, bom is definitely a resto you should be checking out if you like Korean fine dining. First of all, the tasting menu is just beyond words. Second of all, the service is impeccable.I took one of my girlfriends here for her birthday & thank you to the staff of bom for delivering an amazing meal.Worth the money? Ohhhhh, yes!","17 W 19th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-06-24,2023-09-16,bōm,"I thought Oiji Mi was the best place ever but I was proven wrong. Chef Brian Kim and his team are absolutely the best in both places!!  I was surprised my boyfriend last year when he took me to Oiji Mi for my birthday but this year was Bōm. I'm Korean but I've never had anything like this.From the moment we entered, we were offered non-alcoholic drinks, super pretty and delicious. Just like last year or even more, the staff were nothing but genuinely welcoming and sincere. (Born and raised in NY, I've experienced so much ""fake"" hospitality; people doing their jobs because they have to.) We were then taken to the back of Oiji Mi, which is where Bōm is located (felt like a private secret room).Every single course was absolutely amazing. From the vegetables/fish to meat to pastries as mentioned online (don't want to spoil the actual menu). The freshness of each ingredient made each course so rich in flavor in every bite. Literally an explosion of flavors every bite. The plating was so on point too! They cooked all the meats in front of us; each 3 seats or so had a grill (on a U shaped table, excuse me with my poor description). The ""meat juices"" made things even more flavorful. Lastly, we were blessed with the desserts plus a teeny birthday cake! They had a mini music box that played ""happy birthday"" as wellTo top things off, we were able to get pictures with Chef Brian Kim (12 of them!) I simply love both places but Bōm was definitely more classy and romantic. Forever recommend!!","17 W 19th St New York, NY 10011"

Distant from heavy activities at the bar and dining are of OIJI Mi, this tasting counter in the back with high ceiling with exquisite ambiance became my one of favorite restaurants to dine in in the city after two dinners here! Diligently crafted and executed at its finest formality and taste, each course is an edible art. Mostly delicate bites of seafoods and vegetables to start before getting to the meats grilled right in front of you by chefs, and the way they serve meat course was constantly finest elegant bites. The Korean authenticity was in the ingredients and the philosophy through the course. Exciting wine pairing by their reputed sommeliers with their extensive wile selection is a must! Thanks for fantastic dinner!","17 W 19th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-06-12,2023-09-16,bōm,"Wow this restaurant might just be my new favorite restaurant in NYC. Tucked away behind Oiji Mi, this restaurant gave the impression of a speakeasy, and the interior is absolutely gorgeous. Every diner has full visibility into the chefs preparing the meals and grilling the meats.The menu starts with the most delicious small bites, my favorite being the bluefin tuna in a seaweed wrap. It is then followed by a series of seafood courses -- my favorites here were the sablefish, which quite literally melted in my mouth, and the gamtae noodle with sea bream.Next came the star of the show, the meats. The meats were so tender and prepared so carefully with delicious supplements, such as the kristal caviar. My favorite meat course definitely had to be the wagyu galbi, which had the perfect cut and melted in my mouth.We ended with a seaweed rice course with seaweed wraps, the most comforting soup, and side dishes and delicious dessert... I loved the yogurt ice cream with calamansi pudding!Bom is definitely a must visit for anyone who loves fine dining. The flavors of each course were so elegant, complex, delicate at the same time, and really highlighted the main elements of each dish.","17 W 19th St New York, NY 10011"

The first five courses or so are seafood centric. The next five courses or so are waygu centric, waygu from different cuts, and different parts of the world. Yes, they actually do tastes different. But all great. The restaurant has only been opened about two or three months. And I predict they will be awarded a Michelin Star next year.","17 W 19th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-05-12,2023-09-16,bōm,"stopped in on a recent trip to NYC and bom was one of my top meals that week, loved the experience. It's located in a very nice back room of Oiji Mi, counter style seats surrounding a prep area with grills built into the countertops (they slow cooked beef throughout the meal).Service was great, drinks are more focused on wine/wine pairings, but we did sample all 3 of their cocktails which were ok (nothing blew us away and they were pricier than most).The menu was fantastic from beginning to end. Loved the different courses, there were a number of seafood courses before moving onto the meats (diver scallop, king crab, sea bream, sablefish, abalone). For meats - they were all prepared/aged differently and it was fun tasting the differences between them. Every piece was cooked perfectly. Desserts were great as well. Very special experience and I would definitely return on future trips","17 W 19th St New York, NY 10011"
2023-03-28,2023-09-16,bōm,"Bōm is the new Korean meat-forward chef's table from the folks (literally and metaphorically) behind the Michelin 1 Star Oiji Mi. As a foodie who loves exploring unique culinary experiences, I was eager to see what this highly anticipated restaurant had to offer. Spoiler alert: it opened in February 2023, and I've already been twice. One of the best fine dining experiences I've ever had.From the moment I stepped into the sleek, stylish space, I knew I was in for a treat. The purple-veined, white marble dining counter immediately caught my eye, and the oak-beamed ceiling added a touch of traditional Korean charm.But it was the food that truly stole the show. Bōm's 12-plus-course menu focuses on meat, but it's not overwhelming. Each dish was expertly crafted and presented with artistic flair. The meal started with small bites featuring delicious veggies and seafood, such as the caviar tart filled with pear and tofu, and the sablefish in a chili broth. My personal fave: the norwegian king crab egg custard. The egg melts in your mouth while you get the chewy juiciness of the crab.The four beef courses that followed were cooked in front of us on custom-built side-venting brass grills, and each dish was more impressive than the last. The 45-day dry-aged rib-eye served with shaved black  truffle and radish kimchi, was a standout dish that left me wanting more.But what truly amazed me was the tenderloin aged for five days in nuruk, a wheat- and rice-based starter culture used to produce Korean alcohol. The beef was rubbed with the powder, which gave it a unique nutty taste, and then grilled and topped with Kristal caviar and Hokkaido uni. It was an unforgettable dish that showcased Chef Brian Kim's innovative approach to Korean cuisine.Overall, Bōm is a must-visit for anyone looking for an upscale Korean dining experience in New York City. The food is exceptional, the presentation is stunning, and the ambiance is chic and sophisticated. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates the art of fine dining.","17 W 19th St New York, NY 10011"

Called Bubble Dream.  I'm not much of a Rose drinker but it paired really well with the food.  Service was great, a little on the loud side but works well with a group up to 8 which is what we had both nites.","13 E 37th St New York, NY 10016"

And I was instantly intrigued by the cold appetizers. I ordered the jellyfish salad and it was cold and refreshing. It was delicious, though I would've wanted it to be spicier since the menu noted that it'd be spicy.The staff were attentive and friendly. The only con is that the space in between other tables are pretty tiny, I had to wiggle myself into the bench table in between other tables that were eating.","13 E 37th St New York, NY 10016"

Here's what we got:Szechuan Cold Noodle - probably my favorite thing we ordered! So yummy and flavorful and had the perfect spice kick!Veggie Potstickers - these were just ok. Found them to be a little oily and lacking filling. Even the filling was not very flavorfulGarlic Eggplant - this was also good but not great. I expected a bit more of a garlicky flavor but it was sweet and tangy and still tastyMapo Tofu - this was really good I just wish it was spicier! Nothing we got was the spicy but I expected a bit more of a kick with this dish but it wasn't spicy at all. Still tasted good though!Overall, I probably wouldn't be back since there's so many other places to try in the city. If you're in the area and craving sichuan food, still a great option!

2023-09-03,2023-09-16,CHILI,"This Sichuan place felt very New York, with slickly dressed servers and an outside seating deck set up in addition to the smallish interior. They have marked vegan and gluten-free options; it wasn't evident from the online menus I viewed but they actually had quite a few in the vegetables section. However, the classic dish that I wanted, my ma po tofu, was also available vegetarian for me.My tofu was strongly spiced, albeit surprisingly without a lot of the numbing sensation that makes this style of cuisine distinctive. Perusing other reviews, it seems experiences vary on this point. It was still delicious. The more distinctive element actually turned out to be the goji berry tea I ordered, which steeped into a fantastic complement to my meal with just a hint of sweetness. If I went back, maybe I'd have to specifically ask them to whack me with the maximum levels of spices, but it was a good overall experience.","13 E 37th St New York, NY 10016"
2023-09-02,2023-09-16,CHILI,"Considering how many great competitors there are in this area, this restaurant has no excuse.Wontons - 2/10Something as classic as chili wontons should taste perfect.  The filling was absolutely vile in texture, a weirdly brittle yet mushy and utterly mysterious chew in its consistency, akin to the inside of a 7-11 jamaican beef patty after someone threw up in it. Chili oil was good, skin was fine.Cold sesame noodles - 2/10Again, a very simple dish, done very well at many other establishments in the city.  It's too sweet here, and the flavors in general are way too garish for the kind of simple and appetite-revving intentions of the dish.Double cooked pork - 7/10Finally, a dish that tasted good.  Flavors were all there, but the pork itself was on the dry side.Long pepper chicken - 5/10Exceptionally mediocre, and the chicken was bone-dry.Szechuan string beans - 5/10Once again, how do you mess up the most standard, simple dish?  The string beans were so undercooked that the center of every bean was crunchier than a raw potato.Mapo tofu - 6/10Not great but the flavors were all there.  Again, way too sweet.Fish in chili oil - 6/10Too sweet, not enough flavor.5/10 Places like han dynasty, blue willow etc all exist in the vicinity.  You can't go to Chili when other, far superior options exist.","13 E 37th St New York, NY 10016"

We were seated immediately at a spacious table for 8.We got the following:- Cumin lamb (3.5/5):  I'm a big cumin lamb guy and this one lacks some depth of flavor. It's predominantly a salty flavor. It was marked as spicy level 2, but wasn't that spicy (I'm a below average Asian in terms of spice tolerance).- Crab tofu (4/5): I've had better at different places.- Fragrant fish (4/5) Surprisingly, this stood out the most. Great soft texture and light but not boring flavor.- Golden corn (3/5)- String beans: good enough, big portionsTheir cocktail menu's nice art almost baited me into buying a drink.

Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but you'd expect more of an experience for the price.","25 Bogart St Brooklyn, NY 11206"
2023-07-28,2023-09-16,Eyval,"I was just invited to eat dinner here by some friends on a whim so I didn't really know what to expect and Eyval did not disappoint!We started off with some drinks the Limoo Margarita, Jaam E Shirin, and the Saffron Martini. All of them were really good, the limoo margarita and the jaam e shirin were both refreshing and citrusy without being too sweet. The saffron martini was really unique and delicious as well.We started with the breads, both were delicious but the Komaj was our favorite. The turmeric and cumin add an amazing flavor to the bread and the texture is great. We had the whipped feta and the roasted carrots as well. The whipped feta was AMAZING and I loved the carrots as well they were roasted to perfection and the accompanying sauce was so tasty.We had a few bigger plates with the Kashke Bademjan and the Mushroom Kabob both of which were incredible. I have never tried a dish like the Kashke Bademjan before and would definitely recommend it if you like eggplant. It was also presented beautifully and all of the elements play together really well. The mushroom kabob was cooked really well and the sauce with lentils hit super hard it was well balanced and the textures were amazing.We also had the lamb ribs which were cooked so well the meat fell off the bone and the peppers added a nice kick.Lastly we had the Gormeh Sabzi which was also cooked incredibly well and was so flavorful. There was a tangy element in the dish which I felt was a bit strong but it was still really good.Our server was super helpful in helping us pick dishes and took great care of us. He recommended we order 1-2 dishes per person and we ended up ordering 8 between 4 of us which was certainly more than enough. We left stuffed and with leftovers!I was surprised by how big the restaurant was but it was so comfortable and well decorated without being overbearing.Would definitely recommend stopping in!","25 Bogart St Brooklyn, NY 11206"

2023-07-21,2023-09-16,Eyval,"Food - 5 starsDrinks - 3 starsConcept and overall vibe - weighted 5 stars because they innovate and elevate my people's cuisine.We will be back. Have you ever been to a restaurant and within the first few minutes realized this is going to be one of several visits? That's exactly what happened to me  here. I've been eating and cooking Persian food most of  my life and I really am part jealous and inspired to recreate the dishes served here. What we ordered:Sides: naan Barbari and carrot yoghurt yumminess. The bread was perfectly baked. The carrots with yogurt was deceptively delicious. The balance of that dish had me picking it apart curious to understand why it was so good. The potatoe tadiq checked the box and soothed my desire to eat a mountain of rice.Mains: koobideh and salmon kabob. These two dishes were the equivalent of a bicycle kick winning goal in the World Cup finals. The koobideh was perfectly mixed, seasoned and cooked. The salmon was perfect cooked and nestled on a bed of the most balanced and addictive sauce I think I've ever had at a Persian restaurant. It was sour (from pomegranate molasses), herby, and with the most perfect amount of heat (which is not typical for Persian cuisine). It will be a few visits before I will be able to not order that dish.Dessert: rice pudding - the simplicity of this dish again just capped the evening with a statement. Honey, strawberry, candied pistachio. Simple bliss.Drinks: arguably the weakest showing at Eyval. Aside from the saffron martini, every cocktail we had (Negroni or margarita) was really unbalanced and seem to feature Persian ingredients as the primary focal point vs making a great cocktail that happened to have Persian ingredients. Example the margarita had no agave or simple syrup to balance to balance the flavors. Suggestion: use sumac simple syrup. I think the imbalance of ingredients was just symptomatic of the greater issue: they need an adult to devise a better set of recipes and take ownership of the service and execution. If they fix this skill gap this place would be unstoppable.","25 Bogart St Brooklyn, NY 11206"
2023-07-18,2023-09-16,Eyval,"This place is crazy good. The restaurant is warm, welcoming, and somehow modern yet homey. The cocktails were all delicious and unique. Every single thing we ordered (minus the potato tahdig which I would pass on) was fantastic. The ice cream sandwiches were a great way to finish. Highly recommend","25 Bogart St Brooklyn, NY 11206"
2023-07-15,2023-09-16,Eyval,"Recommended appetizers: Kashke Bademjan, Kabob Koobideh (as an appetizer)Recommended mains:  Albaloo Polo, Ghormeh Sabzi (even if overpriced)Is this traditional Persian food? No (mostly)Should you expect tasty variants? Yes (mostly)Are the prices a tad high? Yes (well it is in this area so of course)Anyway I was here with one of my group a good while back. I have had Persian food from several restaurants in the city before but as of this point, I haven't found one that was any close to the quality I find in northern New Jersey but having heard glowing reviews of their more popular sister restaurants, I signed up for this one. The service was friendly and the ambience was unique with black and white films on the wall. To drink, I had a Sour Cherry Sharbat which was $10. This was a small for the price and way too icy and wasn't worth it even with the pretty good flavor. The prices for the dishes below are based on the current menu but we were there back in March so the prices might have been a bit cheaper back then.We got their two type of bread. The Komaj Bread with turmeric and cumin for $5 is more of a flatbread. It also usually has dates or something sweet inside but the savory version here was tasty with a good texture. The Barbari Bread with nigella and sesame for $6 was comparatively larger and a bit closer to the sangak bread found in most Persian spots.To have with the bread we got the Whipped Feta Spread ($12) with fresh herbs, walnuts, and radish. The herbs covered up the feta spread and it had a nice presentation. It was a tad small for the price but pretty tasty.Also vegetarian was the Eggplant & Cured Yogurt ""Kashke Bademjan"" for $18 with mint oil, fried onions, garlic chips, and walnuts. I have had this dish at several Persian spots as this is one of my favorite dishes and the version here was different but tasty. Compared to the usual version, the eggplant was not mashed but rather two large pieces. While the presentation was nicer, I would say it was a bit harder to eat but it was nice to have a different texture compared to usual version.The final vegetarian dish was the Potato Tahdig with sour plum sauce which was $12. This was priced as a side dish and came out as a large hash brown like object with said sauce. Tahdig generally refers to the crispier rice on the bottom and is a beloved food and this version was alright. It was a bit fluffier than usual and not as crispy (possibly due to the potato) but the sauce was nice.We also got the Kabob Koobideh for $19 consisting of a single ground beef & lamb brisket (kabob) with tomato butter and saffron rice. Koobideh refers to ground meat kabobs and is my preferred style. The meat was tender and juicy and the tomato butter was a delicious fun touch. It was perhaps a bit overpriced but I think it would work as an appetizer instead of it being a usual main dish.Unfortunately, they didn't have the fesenjan anymore having replaced it on the menu with Albaloo Polo with duck, duck leg confit, sour cherries, almond, pistachio, basmati rice, and saffron. I think it was around $40 wand it was my favorite of the mains. While I love fesenjan, I didn't mind this instead. The duck was tender and there was plenty of sour cherry as expected for albaloo. I wish it contained some tahdig for more texture but solid.The Ghormeh Sabzi ($45) with braised veal shank & herbs in a black lime stew, with herb tahdig and basmati rice was a unique take on the usual stew. A bit less sour than other versions with a massive tender shank. Very tasty though perhaps a bit overpriced.The Lamb Rack ""Shishlik"" for $44 with cumin yogurt, preserved herbs, and basmati rice was alright. I prefer lamb chops with more of a sear but the bottom part was nice.For dessert we had our own. I went with the Fereni with rose yogurt custard, orange blossom honey, strawberries, and pistachios. Good rosewater and good sourness with good crunch. I think it was $12 or similar. Our other dessert was some type of cream puff. I don't remember but it was a similar price and it was OK.Solid food though not all of the new interpretations worked. Mid/low 4 with a couple standouts.","25 Bogart St Brooklyn, NY 11206"

2023-08-07,2023-09-16,Anto,"The atmosphere was good but not worth the price. I would never again pay this price for just pieces of meat not even marinated with special sauce. This restaurant tries to be a high-end Korean restaurant which is a complete oxymoron, Don't FALL FOR IT!","243 E 58th St New York, NY 10022"
2023-08-01,2023-09-16,Anto,"From the moment I stepped inside, the inviting ambiance of the restaurant swept me off my feet. The mix of traditional Korean elements and modern touches created a warm and cozy atmosphere that instantly put me at ease.I decided to go all-in and opted for their signature Korean steak course. And boy, was I blown away! The tenderness and flavor of the meat were beyond words - each bite was like a burst of heaven in my mouth. The seasoning was spot-on, and the meat was cooked to perfection, leaving me wanting more after every mouthful.What made the experience even better was the attentive and friendly staff especially Alex. They were so knowledgeable about the menu and offered me some fantastic recommendations on drinks. Throughout the meal, they made sure I had everything I needed, making me feel like a extra cared for.The cherry on top was the delightful assortment of side dishes that accompanied my main course. Each one added a unique twist of Korean flavors, turning the entire meal into a culinary adventure.As I savored each moment, I couldn't help but feel grateful for such a wonderful dining experience. Anto Korean Steak House truly knows how to treat their guests, making the evening feel special and memorable.Whether you're a seasoned fan of Korean cuisine or someone looking to try it for the first time, I highly recommend paying a visit to Anto Korean Steak House. Trust me, you won't be disappointed! It's a place that leaves a lasting impression, and I can't wait to go back for more mouthwatering delights.","243 E 58th St New York, NY 10022"

The interior had a modern and luxury. This place is pure extravagance mixed with a touch of Korean charm. I ordered the passion fruit mojito.Tropical sipping on these expertly crafted beverage was absolute delight.My husband and I, we got wagyu course meal. The preparation and presentation must have been top-notch.Starting with with the wagyu tartare, Tteojgalbi pancake, Truffle egg duffle, it's a culinary adventure in itself. The wagyu platter ( Filet minon, NY strip, Ribeye and Galbi) with rich marbling an unparalleled taste and texture. For me Filet minon was best. My husband said Ribeye was best. I made a lettus wrap with wagyu. These collaboration was just melted my tongue. House made unique soybean paste, left me in awe with every bite.The Last meal course was soybean stew, Pot of rice and side dishes(Banchan) was upscale quality.Dessert ( strawberries) also made me a satisfaction.Overall, it was great food, good atmosphere, nice steps.Absolutely I'll give this place 5 stars","243 E 58th St New York, NY 10022"

It was an amazing and fun experience as the servers would cook for you and you just sit back and relax. we had a good time there last night, the server was kind and polite, the only thing that we actually didn't like was the fact that we got a table right after the kitchen, but next time we're gonna booked for a better sitting. :)))I ordered seafood courses (Oyster& Daikon, Scallop&Caviar, Shrimp&Avocado, Truffle Egg Soufflé, Freshwater Eel with Black Raspberry& Assorted Ssam veggies, Uni Seaweed soup, Pot of rice, and Dessert) everything amazing i want to bring my family too !!See you soon","243 E 58th St New York, NY 10022"

2023-06-15,2023-09-16,Gran Electrica,"Yum!!!! Started off with chips and guac which were a little small for the price but very delicious. Next, Birria tacos and quesadillas were ordered as an entree. An order of tacos comes with two tacos, which isn't too bad. Birria tacos were amazing and so was the consomme. During my visit, my order was brought to another table but they fixed it by compensating me and still giving me my meal. Amazing service and considerate staff. I sat in the outdoor portion of the restaurant and it was amazing! I definitely would come back","5 Front St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-06-03,2023-09-16,Gran Electrica,"Mexican cuisine in Brooklyn, we had a group event here and we took up half of the backyard open garden space - lovely which you wouldn't be able to tell from the street outside, but a yard space that was green and simple, like a home's space away from the city.Lots of Mexican cocktails and beers, and they had passed Hors D'oeuvres including mini tacos, some small quesadillas that looked more like fried dumplings, a few slices of savory beef on corn tortilla, and shrimp ceviche on a spoon. While not everything was as expected, they certainly ramped up the service even if the food wasn't always something I liked.Interesting spot, will have to come try a meal for the carnitas or tres leches to see how it compares to spots around here in Newark!","5 Front St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

2023-04-25,2023-09-16,Gran Electrica,"Got take out. Mushroom quesadillas were small and tasteless. Vegetarian tacos were barely seasoned, barely cooked pieces of cauliflower and squash. The guac and salsa tasted good. Pork tacos were tasty, but 2 for $17. Terribly overpriced...I would never go back. We had 2 orders of tacos and 3 quesadillas, guac and chips and salsa. It was over $100. Hugely disappointing for a family who need to eat gluten free.","5 Front St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-04-10,2023-09-16,Gran Electrica,"Amazing food and drinks small portions but just right. I had the TROUT AL AJILLO and the PESCADO ESTILO ENSENADA for appetizer. The Trout was amazing bursting with  flovor. I devored the entire plate it was so good.

I will definitely be coming here again next time for brunch.","5 Front St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

The area inside is extended to outside nice sitting area in the front product of COVID times I assume.Outside is open space, tables, benches to sit looks like some stands in the back for merch sales.Drinks u can order in the front we had the Caribbean Breeze I believe was the name, frozen .. wow this was great & nice & strong!Food seems like u have to order on their app/ online? Pretty wild.We got the classic original & White guy can't go wrong w either white guy great combo w the cheeses & classic original very good. The pizza certainly slaps in all the right ways!U place your order then go & pick it up around the corner? I mean I get it again probably some COVID era chances but it's quite the change from regular table service.Overall the pizza is great, fresh from the oven hard to go wrong price wise not terrible, This place now has a very chill vibe it's like hanging out in someone's backyard.","261 Moore St Brooklyn, NY 11206"
2015-01-11,2023-09-16,Roberta's,"I stopped by this place during the week & at first glance I said to my self where the heck is my friend taking me ?? needless to say this place from the outside is not very welcoming looks like you are entering some shady place where bad things can happen once inside I breathe a side of relief Lol... Cozy place not very big , dim lighting & cafeteria style seating with a small bar & a small out door seating area.wait time was 15-30 minutes we walked to the bar to get drinks & noticed available seating , we decide to sit by the bar instead of waiting for a table.Once seated we took a look at the beer selection which are not typical at all & decide to go with the Bluepoint Toasted Lager not bad , nice taste this was our choice for dinner.Small menu with interesting choices for my main meal I went with The Sound & The Fiore this is Mozzarella , Fiore sardo , delicata squash , Calabrian , onion , garlic & sage interesting ingredients mixing very well together pizza was delicious great tasting.My friend had the Beastmaster , this ones tomato, mozzarella , Gorgonzola , pork sausage , onion , Caper & jalapeño also very good.Good service , reasonable prices this place was a nice find since this is not exactly my neighborhood I can't just pop in but I will definitely keep this place in mind.","261 Moore St Brooklyn, NY 11206"

There was some sort of chili honey sauce on top. That was just enough heat and sweetness. The staff is friendly ambience is warm. I will most definitely go back.!Yum yum!,"261 Moore St Brooklyn, NY 11206"
2023-08-29,2023-09-16,Roberta's,A place to definitely grab with your friends. You order in the store and I got two pies of the Margherita pizza.

2023-08-23,2023-09-16,Roberta's,"Took a while to get seated despite being on time for our reservation, looks like part of the place was booked for an event. Ambience was pretty cool, more similar to a bar than a pizzeria but that worked for us. Ordered the Fire and Ice which was a combination of Straciatella and some type of spicy sausage. It was incredible, especially with the accompanying bread. We did a custom pizza which tasted really good, but disappointed by the amount of toppings they put on (specifically the ricotta) even though they were an extra cost. However we had some straciatella leftover and adding it to the pizza was incredible. We got some mezcal based cocktails that were decent, nothing to write home about. Overall, the food is really good, and I would definitely return, but I might opt for Takeout, which seems to be popular anyway","261 Moore St Brooklyn, NY 11206"

2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Pollo D' Oro,"This week I dined at Pollo D'Oro in downtown Brooklyn, and it was quite the experience. The restaurant's ambiance sets the stage for a relaxed and enjoyable meal. It was perfect for a business lunch, their menu offers a fantastic selection, and I found the options to be delectable.On my visit, I tried the Pescado a lo macho, which was tasty, although I feel that the aji cream sauce could be a bit overwhelming for some palates. However, the tostones and empanadas, both chicken and beef, were definitely highlights of the meal.Pollo D'Oro's signature rotisserie chicken is a must-try - hot, juicy, and cooked to perfection. It's an ideal choice for a quick and healthy family dinner. Plus, as the evening unfolds, the restaurant's transformation into a cozy spot for after-work gatherings or romantic evenings adds to its charm. Don't forget to sample their signature Pisco Sour; it's a Peruvian gem not to be missed.  Mojitos come in many fruity options and the purple corn cocktail looks like sangria, but has its own unique flavor!","306 Gold St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-09-10,2023-09-16,Pollo D' Oro,"Ordered a Pisco Sour and Pollo Soltado. Neither was particularly impressive. Over-cooked, dry chicken that was missing the authentic Saltado flavor. Tasted like the sauce was added after cooking the meat instead of marinating it first and tasted more like soy sauce than saltado. And what kind of 'Peruvian' restaurant does not have Aji Amarillo? No rocoto or panca, either. Only sauce available was a green jalapeño garlic which was thankfully tasty enough to add some flavor to an otherwise very bland dish. Peruvian food should never be bland!Service was courteous enough, but the prices were the some of the highest I've seen for Peruvian, even in places with better, more authentic food. Seemed like they might be trying to cash in on the recent popularity of Peruvian cuisine, but might have been better off sticking to Mexican food.My friends were happy with their dishes, but I'm not sure how much Peruvian they've had before. I married into a Peruvian family almost 30 years ago and have been learning from them and cooking ever since. I've also been to Peruvian restaurants in several cities around the US. There's almost always slight variations on the classic dishes, but this is probably the most disappointing experience I've had; especially for a dish that should be so simple to do right.","306 Gold St Brooklyn, NY 11201"
2023-08-13,2023-09-16,Pollo D' Oro,"We were 3 Peruvians eating in this beautiful restaurant, unfortunately it was not what I expected for my daughter's 24th birthday.The place and the attention were very nice, the pisco sour was good, they didn't have picarones but they were kind with the 3 leches for my daughter, with candles and two other desserts.The Jalea was a very good portion (one pernos) but tasteless and the fish didn't  have a good texture, the Aji de Gallina tasteless and without that slight ""picante""  it should have, the ""original"" ceviche tasteless and the same problem with the texture of the fish.I ordered an extra portion of Choclo, of course I would pay, but when the waitress consulted in the kitchen, they told her ""no because the portions of choclo are limited.""The wine, which we knew by brand and because I have a couple of bottles at home that are the delight of my friends, didn't  have the same flavor or bouquet.The price was not in accordance with what we received, if you pay by card (debit or credit) they charge you 3%, 20% gratitude is already included (that is bad service or good service is the same) but if you pay with Venmo or Zelle don't charge you extra.Honestly, this comment is not to destroy but to suggest to the owners that they look for another chef, they have a lot of potential.We will definitely continue our search for some ""Peruvian flavor in New York"" that is at least close to it.","306 Gold St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

Following a surgery, I thought I should go to Kyuramen to celebrate. I asked for a back room and the hostess told me it's reservation only, something I didn't know. Perhaps she was just relaying what her boss told her, but I felt very brushed off :/. I asked if I could reserve a back room later in the day and she said they didn't accept same day reservations. The food continues to be swell, I just feel really disappointed I didn't get to celebrate in a special way and was brushed off and sent to a corner instead.","210 E 14th St New York, NY 10003"

Solid, reliable, delicious ramen and cool dishes (the rice burger is a tad impractical and hard to eat, but very yummy overall).If you have any hesitations about visiting, wipe 'em away and try it out. I especially recommend anything they serve with black garlic. It's amazing.

2023-09-02,2023-09-16,Kyuramen - Union Square,This place is conveniently located near the subway and the decor is very cute. The restaurant is deceptively big and has semi-private seats in the back. The staff was also friendly.I got the mild miso ramen. It was very tasty and satisfying. I do think the broth could have been... thicker maybe? But overall I really enjoyed it. The pork in particular was delicious.I recommend getting a reservation if you can. It can get crowded quickly!,"210 E 14th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-28,2023-09-16,Kyuramen - Union Square,"We came here on at lunchtime on a Saturday and were seated immediately. It was surprisingly quiet for a Saturday lunch.We ordered the combo for 2. The popcorn chicken was pretty good, but could be crispier. My partner got the Sapporo Miso ramen and I got the Kyushu Tonkatsu Shio Ramen. He said the Sapporo Miso ramen was pretty good.The Tonkatsu ramen had such a bland, watery broth. Typically, I find the broth to be rich, and on the saltier side, but this was bland by my standards.  The noodles has a pleasant texture, but I feel like the lack of flavor in the broth really ruined the overall experience. I would not be ordering this again.The dessert (cherry blossom jelly and matcha pudding) had wayyyy too much gelatin, resulting in a rather hard consistency (this probably served as my collagen supplement for the day!). The consistency made it a little hard to eat since we had to dig the spoon pretty hard into the food. The flavor was also not very pronounced, either in the matcha nor the cherry blossom, but I did like that it was not too sweet. I would describe the flavor as more fruity than actual sakuraOverall, in my opinion, this place is probably more for a nice ambiance and an instagrammable plate than actual good food.","210 E 14th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-27,2023-09-16,Kyuramen - Union Square,"No wait on a Sunday at 4pm for 3 people. The place itself is adorable with little rooms in the back for dinning. I like how private it feels and there's a little call button when you're ready to order or just need service. We all got jelly sake since we'd never heard of it and it was yummy. If you get a combo ramen it also comes with a Thai tea and a pork bun. The Thai tea was delicious and sweet and the pork bun was savory and had a nice sauce. We also got the chicken gyoza which was really good. The sauce was unlike other gyoza sauces I've tried, less vinegary and more sweet. All of us enjoyed our ramen. The pork was tender and savory and the noodles absorbed the flavor from the broth beautifully. The mild broth was very spicy though!","210 E 14th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-21,2023-09-16,Kyuramen - Union Square,Got the chicken ramen and gyoza. Sometimes ramen is overpowering in saltiness for me but that was not the case at all at this place. Hard to find ramen this good where I'm from.,"210 E 14th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-20,2023-09-16,Kyuramen - Union Square,"Our first visit in awhile after the horrible experience we had at Marafuku Ramen further south.We waited not too long for a table, sitting amongst the delivery guys (this was during the week). We skipped ordering appetizers as we knew, from experience, the ramen would hit the spot (we order more maybe during the winter).When we were ready to order, after being seated, though I had to grab the attention of our waiter, though he was hovering near us. I requested the free dessert with check in, guessing that if you don't do it then and there, you may forfeit it or something. I'm not sure that was the case because our waiter's English wasn't the greatest, and the QR code at the table wasn't doing what it was supposed to so I had to check in twice on my phone.I forgot what was available but it wasn't what was listed on the standing table sign for some reason (some type of jelly and matcha pudding) so I just went with what I remembered the waiter mentioning (""ice cream"") which seemed unproblematic.The ramen were perfect: hearty soup with filling sides. As I ate I thought about making ramen at home, which we all sometimes to, right, but never seems to happen because of places like Kyuramen!Anyway, when the mass-produced Nestle cone came, I was disappointed, though my partner was not. (In Japanese restaurants, ice cream usually comes in a small dish.) I am curious to see what the matcha pudding would be but I'm also afraid it'll come mass-produced too unlike what the photo in the menu suggests.","210 E 14th St New York, NY 10003"

The patrons next to us had one of their shopping bags out really close to our part of the counter (the restaurant has hooks for these at the bar but these patrons were just being selfish). We ordered a $20 junmai which we thought of as a starter (the canned jelly drinks they offer are trash: The jellies get trapped in the openings of the drinks). Our waiter was really sweet and asked whether we wanted food, suggesting maybe we shouldn't leave our stomachs empty with just alcohol. We ended up ordering veggie spring rolls later, with him not missing a beat. Everything was absolutely delicious,  and one bottle of junmai turned out to be enough for the two of us.Just wish I didn't see so many plastic bags being used in their pick up and delivery service, bu I guess this is still typical during the pandemic, though it shouldn't be.We're gonna try the Yelp check in to get the complimentary dessert. Just hope we remember!","210 E 14th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-08-17,2023-09-16,Kyuramen - Union Square,I went to the one in forest hills. The place looks great visually. The 2 for one deal is great when you don't know what to order. There's also a location in union square which I haven't been to yet but having multiple locations means their food is great. Their food is delicious. The kageyage is great and the ramen is a staple. The desserts are visually appealing and I do like the subtle art of having a hand at creating your desserts. Will go again but maybe a different location.,"210 E 14th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-07-29,2023-09-16,Café Mish Mosh,We were trying to go somewhere else but realized after we got there that they were cash only. So we walked down to block to Mish Mosh after seeing their menu. It took a little bit of time to get seated and seemed that they were a bit behind on service. A few people came up to the bar asking where their coffee was and we saw another guy waiting longer than he should've to get his order taken. We thought we were going to be there an hour just for breakfast. Surprisingly things turned around pretty quick. We saw people getting their food and coffees and we also got our food within 10 minutes of being seated. The waiter was super apologetic for our wait. The food was excellent. I got the pancakes while my wife got the hummus. Pancakes were not thin and chewy but were a bit thicker and more cake-y. The whip cream and strawberry jam were a great touch to the overall flavor.,"50 Bowery New York, NY 10013"

2023-06-11,2023-09-16,Café Mish Mosh,"We found breakfast inedible.  Got the egg sandwich and overnight oats.  Egg sandwich was served on a dinner roll you wouldn't enjoy, bacon undercooked and scrambled eggs meh.  The salad that was served with was inedible - so much vinegar and so overdressed.  The other dish, overnight oats was so sweet, it was also inedible.  Left two bites in.  No refunds.","50 Bowery New York, NY 10013"
2023-05-06,2023-09-16,Café Mish Mosh,"This place is awesome! Great decor. I had a few mezze dishes - hummus, pumpkin kibbeh (delicious), cauliflower, chicken wings (not oily). Luv them all. I got a taste of the falafel rice bowl with baba, tahini and pickled radish (thin slices). Did not like it. The pickled radish was ok though. The falafel are mini-balls, more outside than inside, which is more of the fried stuff. I like the mezzes much better. For dessert I had the mini-knafeh cakes (1 mini round piece). That was small but very tasty and different than the typical cheese knafehs. It was more of a custard pastry.They have a decent cocktails and wine list. They also have a bar area with seats in the front. Haven't tried the kebabs or sandwiches yet. They also have a breakfast menu, including a congee with bacon in it. I'm curious about the Asian fusion dishes. Will have to try their breakfasts.Separately, inside this place is OS NY gaming (video games) center with a membership option. There's one unit that has about 60 arcade games on it. It shares the same space beyond the cafe. There are two shelves at the top of the high ceilings with the waving lucky cats figures. Staff said this used to be a Chinese factory and they left the cats. It looks like a good collection to me.The staff is very friendly. They even gave me a tour of the gaming center in the back. The bathroom is in the back past all the computers. This place is right next to Hotel 50 Bowery. It almost looks part of it with separate entrances. I walked right past it since the Cafe Mish Mosh sign is smaller compared to the big hotel building, but it's right there. Worth a try. Also has a small selection of board games. Feels like someplace else and I wouldn't have guessed in the heart of Chinatown. More like a Soho feel. Not rushed at all.","50 Bowery New York, NY 10013"

Loved the little details of the decor.The menu has many Lebanese favorites. Tonight we tried:Shrimp kebab: the plating of the shrimp seemed over the top, but did not disappoint.Chicken kebab: tasty, lots of depth to the flavor. Was a little disappointed at how little chicken there was on the skewer. Note: not chunks of kebab meatHummus: divine, appreciated the toasted chickpeas. Comes with one pita. We ordered an extraBeef shawarma: I'll remember this one for a long time. It was delicious, the caramelized onions were *chefs kiss*Roasted tahini cauliflower: topped with pomegranate, I really liked this dish.

2023-07-04,2023-09-16,The Wren,I came in at 1AM with my girlfriend and two friends after work and had THE best cocktails made by Mike. I originally came in for one round but the cocktails and conversation were so good and Mike was such a sweetheart and made us feel comfortable that we ended up there just shy of closing. It was the 3rd of July and he could've easily kicked us out but instead was the most hospitable experience in NYC. Will definitely be back again!!,Verified by Business

I think we must've gotten there before the rush, but that's fine with us. We had gotten an avocado bowl, waffles, and this delicious goat cheese and artichoke dip. All items were beyond amazing. The service and ambiance were also fantastic.I definitely think this is a great spot that we happened to stumble upon. If I'm in the area again, I would definitely stop by. I wholly recommend!",Verified by Business

Snip, snap!We did end up getting a seat outside, and the ambiance was nice but the traffic going up and down bowery had me unable to hear my own thoughts at points.After a subpar espresso martini, I pivoted to a Watermelon High that also ended up being subpar.

2023-05-10,2023-09-16,The Wren,"Really enjoyed my visit to The Wren while visiting NY. I was looking for a restaurant that was open late and luckily their kitchen was open past 11:30pm. It was mid week so it was pretty calm. Such a lovely little place.You walk in and you have a few tables around, the bar area and more tables. We sat in the back area and it was really enjoyable. Real candlelit dinner. Our server was really friendly.We started with a sour beer and a Tom collins. The sour beer was really tasty, as was the Tom collins. Then ordered the white bean hummus which was recommended by the server. It was so delicious and crunchy. We also ordered the veggie burger, it was so fresh and flavorful. Great portion and taste. Also ordered a side of fries which was a big portion and really fresh fries.The ambiance was great. The food was yummy. Truly a little gem in the area.I did try coming back over the weekend and the security was really rude and said the kitchen was closed at 11pm but not letting that encounter ruin my first experience! But definitely keep in mind the kitchen closing time may vary as can some of the staff. Overall, still worth the experience on a week night.",Verified by Business
2023-04-22,2023-09-16,The Wren,The Wren is a good spot for Happy Hour or a late night spot to end the night. I like the ambiance and it is good for those types of groups where you have some that a bit more casual but others who are a bit dressier.,Verified by Business

2023-09-12,2023-09-16,Olle,"If you are looking for Korean cold noodles in NYC, do not go anywhere else and come to Olle. The nangmyeon is the best in the city and even shines in comparison to amazing ktown food in LA. I absolutely loved the chewiness of the noodle and how refreshing the soup is. If you don't love cold noodle, please give this place a try before you say more.The pork belly and Korean bibimbap are good as well but not WOW. The cold noodles and banchan are the two wow factors. Ambiance is great as well - very chic, wooden bar-esque vibes.","11 E 30th St New York, NY 10016"

2023-08-27,2023-09-16,Olle,"I think this place just became my favorite Korean restaurant in Ktown. I came here for weekend lunch and got their gamja tang. 10/10, it was so delicious. I usually can not tolerate a lot of spiciness but this was perfect. The broth was spicy enough that it leaves your lips feeling a little hot but not too spicy that you get indigestion. It also contains 3 huge pork bones with tendons, soft bones and ligaments. If you love slurping on bones, then this dish is for you. It also comes with rice and you get to choose between purple rice or white rice. I got white rice but next time I might opt for the purple rice. The banchan is nothing special, although they gave me a second refill of scallion pancakes :D. Their kimchi was on the sweeter side which I liked. I would definitely come back again to try their sullongtang and naengmyeon during the weekday.","11 E 30th St New York, NY 10016"

It's the perfect refreshing dish to pair with anything else in this restaurant. I find myself craving the naengmyeon here just to have it in the summer. I've gotten the bossam and the jaeyook bokkeum and it is just too good. This place is definitely on the pricier side, but I've left incredibly stuffed with just two dishes shared among two people.The waitstaff is also super nice and always make the experience here enjoyable. It gets a bit loud since the tables are a bit closer together, but other than that, I think it's suitable for a more casual place to eat food.For drinks, would recommend the Red Monkey makgeolli if they still have it! It's the red one in the menu. Easy to share among 2-4 people. They also have terra, which is a South Korean lager that's easy to drinks as well.","11 E 30th St New York, NY 10016"

2023-07-10,2023-09-16,Yemen chuanchuan 爺们串串 爷们串串,"It was a very interesting experience as I have never eaten this type of food (Chinese skewer hotpot) before. We came to eat here yesterday (Sunday) and it was not busy. We sat at the booth area & it was comfortable and spacious. Loved the artwork and decor of the place.There were many different types of foods to choose from (you have to use your phone to scan the menu). You can order the food via your phone, or tell the staff. In regards to the skewers, I do not think they were all 80 cents each because some items (lobster, frog, etc) had a metal stick in it + some items had 1 or 2 wooden sticks in it. Maybe each wooden stick is 80 cents each (so if a fish ball has 2 wooden sticks in it, it cost $1.60) + the metal stick (found in the lobster, frog, etc) is also another price. I do have to say that the amount of food on each of the skewers were quite small (half a sausage, 1 lettuce leaf, etc). If you want to be full, you might have to keep coming back to get more skewers. Thankfully, we were not hungry and just wanted to try the food + got a few types.After you finish choosing the skewers, you give it to the staff who gives it to the chef to cook & then it comes dipped in a large pot of spicy broth (you choose the spice level). We ordered mild and it was a bit spicy but super tasty. The broth was super delicious & the skewers were delicious! There is also a bowl of their special oil dipping sauce + other sauces in the front. Honestly, the broth was so amazing, you do not need additional sauce. We got a bowl of rice to eat w/ the broth + skewers & it was deeelicious!We also got an order of their fried milk (that comes w/ condensed milk as a dipping sauce) & it was delicious! It was very different and unique. It was crunchy and savory on the outside & sweet and milky on the inside.Staff was friendly & attentive. The food came out fast & it was tasty. I also agree w/ other yelp reviewers that the amount adds up & you will be surprised w/ your bill.","105 W27 St New York, NY 10001"

The default flavor is a spicy soup base with varying levels of spicy, but they also havd other options.The menu also features other dishes (mostly all spicy), some carbs to pair, and desserts. Overall the food was very tasty, and the skewers are a fun format to eat with friends. The desserts are really great as well!Service was prompt, but their ice machine was unfortunately broken that day. In addition, note that they also charge for dipping sauces. I personally felt that the sauces were not necessary however. Will be back!","105 W27 St New York, NY 10001"

First time for dinner the waiter with blonde hair was amazing, second time for lunch on Saturday service was not as good.Food was good, I prefer the main dishes over the chuan chuan pots. See my photos they are all excellent especially the pig brain.Price is not cheap prepare to pay $60+ per person.  Service today was so so, the waiter was a bit cold and didnt exhibit any hospitality, especially when I'm paying they stand over you, and our waiter forgot our cold appetitzer only brought it out at the end of the meal...so I think 3.5 star is fair. Worth trying if youve never had this type of cuisine. Pro tip, It's very spicy but non spicy doesn't taste as good. Also get the desert it's very good.","105 W27 St New York, NY 10001"
2023-05-07,2023-09-16,Yemen chuanchuan 爺们串串 爷们串串,"Yemen Chuanchuan atmosphere was warm, inviting, and authentic, with over 100 skewers to choose from. The decor was simple yet elegant, with warm lighting and comfortable seating, creating a cozy ambiance that made me feel right at home.Yemen Chuanchuan's specialty is their namesake dish, chuanchuan, which consists of skewered meats, seafood, and vegetables served in a spicy broth making it easier to eat. Each item is individually priced. Inspired by street foods. I ordered a variety of ingredients, including bullfrog, lobster tail, fresh beef, squid, and a mix of vegetables and shrimp balls. The broth was spicy and flavorful, adding heat and depth to each ingredient. Of all the ingredients, the bullfrog was the standout, as it was my first time trying it. The meat was tender and juicy, with a flavor reminiscent of chicken. The lobster tail was also impressive, with succulent and sweet meat that melted in my mouth. The fresh beef was cooked to perfection, with a tender texture and a rich, beefy flavor. The squid was tender and had a pleasant chewiness to it, while the mix of vegetables and shrimp balls added a nice variety of textures. Each bite was a burst of deliciousness that left me craving for more.Fried rice with egg loved the combination of fluffy rice with pieces of shrimp and egg. Perfect satisfying side dish. Fried lotus root stick condensed milk was this dish has a unique combination of sweet and savory flavors. The lotus root stick is crunchy and slightly earthy, while the condensed milk adds a creamy sweetness that balances out the flavors.Braised duck blood has a rich and earthy flavor that pairs well with spicy seasonings. The heat from the spices can help to balance out the richness of the duck blood, and provide a welcome contrast in texture and flavor. Spices creating a complex and fragrant aroma that adds to the overall experience.Fried milk was a unique dish that became one of my favorites. The outside was crispy and crunchy, while the inside was creamy and rich, with a subtle sweetness that perfectly complemented the savory batter, especially the dipping sauce. Pigs feet in broth was a rich and fatty dish full of flavor. Hearty and satisfying side dish. Flavors and textures of pork were enjoyable and comforting.To accompany the meal, ordered a few drinks, including the traditional jasmine honey tea, which was a perfect complement to the spicy flavors of the chuanchuan.All in all, I highly recommend Yemen Chuanchuan to anyone looking for a delicious and authentic Yemeni dining experience. The food was exceptional, the service was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. It's definitely a must try restaurant in New York City.","105 W27 St New York, NY 10001"

Bear in mind the prices can escalate pretty quickly since portions of relatively small per skewer. The broth starts at $15 and each skewer costs 80cents. I ate about 30 skewers and I am usually have a small appetite.Service was great and prompt. All you have to do is pick a skewers on a tray and someone would quickly bring it back to the kitchen to cook before bringing it out to your table.Ambience was pretty life Lee on a Saturday night. I made reservations and was promptly seated once my party was there.It is an interesting place to visit once when you're around the area but I am not sure if I will return given it is relatively gimmicky, and I don't think the food was great.","105 W27 St New York, NY 10001"

It was ridiculous that $14 is charged for the little bit of soup that comes with the skewers, which was not refreshed during our meal and became cold over time. It was also ridiculous that each skewer is only one bite of food (like it had literally one fish ball, or one lettuce leaf on it). It was not an enjoyable dining experience. With all of the other hot pot options in the city, which are at similar prices as Yemen, I will not be coming back to Yemen. There isn't anything appealing about the dining experience or about the price to come back a second time or to recommend this restaurant to others.","105 W27 St New York, NY 10001"

2023-07-29,2023-09-16,Tanner Smiths,"Incredibly well-presented, elevated bar food. The smoked double-cheeseburger is the best burger I've found in Midtown, and they've got an array of creative appetizers like oxtail arancini which are delicious and great for sharing with large groups. Beautiful space and prompt, friendly service- would definitely recommend booking a reservation ahead of time.","204 W 55th St New York, NY 10019"

2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Port Sa'id,YUMMMMMM. Everything was so fresh and tasty. Chill and playful vibe. Service welcoming and respectful. 3 drinks between two of us and a ton of great food (portions are on the large side) including equally tasty dessert and the bill was not stupid like seemingly everywhere else these days. I think it's generally hard to get a resy but I hope we will be back soon.,"350 Hudson St New York, NY 10014"
2023-09-14,2023-09-16,Port Sa'id,"Great spot to grab a drink after work (especially if you work nearby). The bar is through a set of sliding doors by the hostess stand, and the bartender is friendly. I got the Jalapeno mezcal cocktail and it was DELICIOUS. My only old lady gripe is that they had the music on so loud -- I think my co-worker and I were seated by the speakers (wouldn't suggest it if you're planning on talking, I mean yelling at each other). Which was odd, given that there were just four, maybe five people seated at the bar that evening.Must return to try the food!","350 Hudson St New York, NY 10014"
2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Port Sa'id,"This is blatant cultural appropriation at its finest. Israeli restauranteur names his restaurant after one of the largest port city's in Egypt and fails to give credit to the source. Continued theft of culture, food and identity has now extended beyond the boarders of historic Palestine in to neighboring Egypt.  Tisk tisk.","350 Hudson St New York, NY 10014"
2023-09-08,2023-09-16,Port Sa'id,Love the wall of music.  And the food ain't bad either.  The lamb shishlik was my favorite.,"350 Hudson St New York, NY 10014"
2023-09-03,2023-09-16,Port Sa'id,"TLDR: Port Sa'id is a new resto from Eyal Shani. Miznon, etc. If you want an experience with lots of music, lots of people and shareable plates - this is the spot. The Spicy Instruments, the Bread Salad and definitely the Lamb and Chicken Sandwich.Music and vibes are front/center here. Probably not a great place for a quiet intimate meal, this is a place to throw back drinks and eat lots of food in a lively environment.We tried a lot - probably tried too much to be honest. The Spicy Instruments and the Hummus were our favorites. Lots of challah to dip with all the tasty mezze.The Chicken Sandwich was good and the Bread Salad was super unique. The Bread salad was a refreshing salad (good to go with all the meats) with marinated chunks of sourdough and lots of crunchy veggies. The fried anchovies were fine but nothing I'd write home about. The burnt potato was tasty but if you're not into horseradish, you may not like this one. The lamb was good but similar to what you'd expect from the lamb kebabs at the other  restaurants.All in all - if you're in the area and you like Israeli and/or Middle Eastern food, I recommend checking this place out. Definitely a good spot for post-work outings and friends. Not so much for a date night.","350 Hudson St New York, NY 10014"
2023-09-02,2023-09-16,Port Sa'id,"one of the best meals i've had in NYC. We sat at the bar, and while the seats were a bit too tall, we really enjoyed getting to pick our dishes according to the creations the chefs made before us. After consulting our friendly waiter, we decided to start with the hummus, burning potatoes and bread salad (a last-minute addition thanks to recommendations by both our waiter and a chef). I have a propensity for judging the strength of Israeli/Mediterranean restaurants based on their hummus, so I knew this first course would foreshadow the evening. The hummus is garnished chickpeas, juice of tomato, olive oil and spices, and is some of the best I have ever had. It was served alongside beautifully fresh cucumbers covered in olive oil and sea salt as well as challah bread, and I could not get enough. I am not much of a baked potato gal, but the burning potatoes smothered in crème fraiche, black pepper and horseradish snow was very nicely done. From our view at the chef's counter, I'd say the bread salad was the most popular dish of the night - and for good reason. Fresh mint, tomato, cucumber, radish and herbs are diced and doused in olive oil while fresh sourdough is mixed in, soaking up the juices, salts and oils. For mains, my friend and I ordered the lamb shishlik and roast beef sandwich to share. The lamb came juicy and flavorful and was complimented by herbs and dips like the aforementioned sick hummus. The roast beef sandwich nearly stole the show. The spicy mustard, the challah - just get it, if this is your kinda thing. It was incredible.Honorable mention: We each ordered two Bright & Sunnys which were deliciously refreshing and a touch tropical.","350 Hudson St New York, NY 10014"
2023-08-23,2023-09-16,Port Sa'id,"The cheeky menu feels like it's trying too hard, and innovative Mediterranean restaurants seem to be a dime a dozen these days in NYC. But all that being said, I ate some excellent dishes at Port Sa'id, and the environs are fun in an otherwise surprisingly sterile section of Lower Manhattan.The two best bites of the meal were the two (somewhat similar) potato dishes, one a caramelized sweet potato with creme fraiche, the other a serving of potato chunks covered with creme fraiche and an oddly titled garnish of ""horseradish snow."" Well I'm a sucker for creme fraiche, and both of these dishes were thoroughly enjoyed (and the horseradish did add a noticeable and pleasant kick).The hummus, spicy yogurt and eggplant were also all good, although perhaps a bit more similar to other eats I've had recently, and no one in the city has topped Zyara's hummus in Astoria yet as far as I'm concerned. It was nice to have challah to pair.","350 Hudson St New York, NY 10014"
2023-08-16,2023-09-16,Port Sa'id,"We were very excited to try this new restaurant. Israeli cuisine is having a moment in nyc , with really amazing places like Lazer wolf and mesiba The food was tasty by one sided everything had the same salad and tahini, was not very exciting. The most unpleasant pat of the visit was when we were waiting for dessert restaurant employee came a few times to let us know they will be needing the table even though dessert was not brought out fro 15 min and was plenty of empty tables","350 Hudson St New York, NY 10014"
2023-08-13,2023-09-16,Port Sa'id,"Super fun vibe, extremely affordable, which is rare in the city, and the food was simple, yet delish.

Have to say the night we went the loudness of the music was over the top and took away from the experience of the food. Couldn't hear yourself basically or able to speak with those at your table. Some of the food we ordered was very good except the lamb wasn't as amazing as we hoped. Probably would give it another shot another night. I do recommend and love Miss Ada in Fort Greene Brooklyn if you are over the bridge one night.,"350 Hudson St New York, NY 10014"

Meat dishes were overall very dry...The server highly reco the sate lilit with kibat Sambal and yes it had a lot of flavors but meat was DRY - do not get this.Nyonya duck curry was a popular dish but that was meh tooAssam pedas daging tasted good at first but when you keep eating it you notice how rough the texture rly isKerabu beehoon was probably the most appetizing dish here - sour and spicy but not amazed,"20 E 17th St New York, NY 10003"

2023-07-13,2023-09-16,Kebaya,"Excellent food, what a great surprise!  You don't need to be a Malaysian or Singaporean to enjoy them.  Beef cheek was very tender, so was the big squid.  The pork belly was phenomenal, they just melt in your mouth!  Vermicelli noodle and rice dishes are also great.  Attentive, friendly and helpful service.  Comfortable place with interesting Southeast Asia decoration.  All in all, it's a great place to enjoy great food!","20 E 17th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-07-13,2023-09-16,Kebaya,"Wow, the food here was absolutely incredible. Our server, Bee, was so friendly and welcoming. She kindly gave us recommendations and popular dishes from each section, explaining each dish. We ended up ordering everything that she recommended to us.We ordered: Hoppers and Sate Lilit for starters; Laksa Fried Rice (with seafood), Nyonya Duck Curry and Asam Sutong charred squid for entrees; and towards the end we ordered the NYC Kuih for dessert.The hoppers was a thin crepe-like rice batter pancake that came with various sauces. I love the variety of flavor and texture in the different sauces. The tamarind sambal was mildy spicy, the coconut chutney added a nice earthy flavor and thick texture, and the 'gunpowder' was a dry powder with a paste in the middle. The gunpowder had a nice subtle spicy kick to it.I love that they used lemongrass as skewers for the sate, and it really infused the lemongrass flavor into the meat. The sauce with it gave it a mild sweetness and spiciness.My personal favorite dish was the duck curry. It has such a great flavor with the creaminess of the coconut milk. The laksa fried rice had a seafood or veggie option. We ordered the seafood (scallops and shrimp) option. The seafood was delicious and cooked perfectly. The squid was covered in a thick tamarind sauce and cooked so tender. Everything paired together so well.To finish off the meal, we ordered the NYC Kuih (brownie and vanilla ice cream). The brownie had a cakier texture but was still fudgy and delicious. I loved combining a small bite of everything with the crumble and caramel to create that perfect bite.Everything came out fairly quickly, and Bee was very attentive to our needs - making sure our waters were filled.I love the ambiance and decor of the restaurant as well. The decor was reminiscent of Southeast Asian culture and gave off a very warm atmosphere and lighting. The high ceilings made the space feel very open.I will definitely be coming back to try the rest of their dishes.","20 E 17th St New York, NY 10003"
2023-07-10,2023-09-16,Kebaya,"Oh, I was so excited about Kebaya, and so underwhelmed by it. Peranakan food is incredibly difficult to come by. Kebaya in fact claims to be the city's first Peranakan restaurant, which it may be (although some Malaysian spots in the city do have some Peranakan dishes). In particular, I had been searching fruitlessly for a restaurant that has ayam buah keluak, this chicken dish I had in Melaka a few years ago. It's accompanied by this rich, black, truffly nut (that's poisonous if you don't cook it right, yum).Kebaya has it, and that's why I bookmarked it, but I wasn't feeling like chicken when I went, so I figured I'd get something I felt like and then come back another time for the ayam buah keluak.I ordered the nasi ulam with mackerel.The nasi ulam was incredibly strong-tasting, sweet-sour and herby, with a gingery kick. However, it was also chock full of... mushy tomato chunks? Like a salsa. Why?The mackerel, typically an oily rich fish, tasted like almost nothing, which I'm not sure how they pulled off. How do you make mackerel taste like, I don't know, tilapia? After awhile I just got bored and stopped eating not because I was full, but because I was bored of tasteless fish and chunks of random tomato.This is not a standard reaction to good Peranakan food, I promise. It's possible I'll go back for the ayam buah keluak, but I'm certainly less excited to at this point.","20 E 17th St New York, NY 10003"

Unique vibe with art gallery touches but the drinks were kinda bad and I just wouldn't come back again. The barista was very nice though","163 Plymouth St Dumbo, NY 11201"

2023-07-05,2023-09-16,Usagi NY,"I was so excited to try this place because of the gallery and atmosphere. The matcha was one of the worst matchas I've ever had, and I strive to taste ceremonial grade, high-quality matchas. It was also the most expensive I've ever paid for a matcha (which is not out of the ordinary as a LA native and frequent New Yorker). But for it to be really gross, watery, and $8.44 (with reg milk) is really disappointing. They have a menu with what looks like many options of great matcha, but my ""matcha cream"" looked nothing like the pictures. It looked like a cheap donut shop matcha. Not to mention the energy in there was odd upon walking in and the employees weren't very welcoming nor seemed happy to be there.","163 Plymouth St Dumbo, NY 11201"
2023-04-27,2023-09-16,Usagi NY,"Minimalist bookstore and cafe - unexpected oasis for working and reading  because there's so much construction and noise in this area of Dumbo. They have an art gallery in the front of the cafe with rotating exhibits. Delicious, warm Japanese meals for dine-in or takeaway. Not cheap as inflation rises, but generous portions- and worth it if you're going to spend some hours working or reading. I ordered the gyudon, which is tender and perfect with the rice.Loved being surrounded by culture and design books. I'll be back to try other items on the menu.","163 Plymouth St Dumbo, NY 11201"

They have many authentic Japanese teas, drinks, and snacks available for purchase and have a comfy sitting area for you to sip and eat just behind the art gallery. They have plenty of books to pore over while eating your food/drink. If you have any questions about the items on the menu, the person working the register at the tea shop is very knowledgeable!

2022-11-14,2023-09-16,Usagi NY,"I've gone here a few times for lunch. I love their hojicha and combo soba. Their gyudon has a bit too much rice for me, and that's saying something as a rice lover. Their Inari sushi is pretty good and comes with some fresh and pickled vegetables. Similar with their onigiri (I had the spicy tuna). My friend had their chicken curry and didn't like it as much as the gyudon,  but I've yet to try it myself.Eager to try other drinks and food next time.The environment is very nice, cute, fun, and quiet. The staff are sweet and hospitable.Be sure to ask for a receipt upfront if you need it; the default is to not give one, which is fine for many people these days--but not all!","163 Plymouth St Dumbo, NY 11201"
2022-10-04,2023-09-16,Usagi NY,"A great spot to do work or spend an afternoon in! The location around the area has some cute spots but is mostly under constructions as of now, but doesn't impact the ambiance of this place. There are many outlets located around the area along with couches and desks to work. It's fairly quiet in the weekday mornings so you can definitely come by and take calls, but it does pick up in the afternoon and gets quite busy.The coffee is decent- matcha is not the best in my opinion. Would definitely get the food here though as it tastes super homemade and authentic. The noodles and the bulgogi both make for a great afternoon lunch.Would definitely come back to do work or just catch up with someone!","163 Plymouth St Dumbo, NY 11201"
2022-09-29,2023-09-16,Usagi NY,"They have an extremely poor system in giving out their food orders. I placed an order on the QR code that doesn't require an app and it says to wait until they call your name. My food was probably ready for a good 40 minutes but no one said anything. Went up to the register and the lady told me it was ready on the app so...where was it? It was hiding on the side behind the counter. I never received a ready notification anywhere. Anyways, that system is pretty shitty as they'll sometimes call names out and then won't.As such, food was mediocre. Gyudon was about $18 after tax. It had a lot of rice and onion and was just overall really mushy. Might have been the fact that it was just sitting there but I grade things as I receive them. The matcha latte was ok but cost me about $8 for the smallest serving which is fine depending on the quality of matcha used. I heard their coffee is supposedly good but never got the chance to try it.Good work space with wifi and environment but gets extremely busy during lunch. Not sure if I would come by here again in the future since it seems to be a hot mess.","163 Plymouth St Dumbo, NY 11201"

Reminds me a lot of the stationery and book stores back in Tokyo (thinking Iidabashi area specifically)! The drink is definitely pricey but since you can sit for a while I think it makes sense. I didn't love my drink that much, felt like the matcha got watered down by the ice, and kuromitsu jelly were diced up too tiny for me to really enjoy it.

There were maybe 4 other parties for our wait staff but wee got no check-in on the meal, no smiles or anything really.

You know those joints, buy a beer and get a free pie or hot dog. Kind of wild to think I saw that pop punk band RVIVR here as well as a bunch of doom metal bands some 10+ years ago and here I am now wolfing down a pesto eggplant sammie at the chef's counter.Anyway!

The short rib panini was tasty but needed a little more flavor that I got by adding the sauce from the side potatoes and the salsa verde from the breakfast burrito.

2023-09-15,2023-09-16,Tonchin,"I had really high expecations for this place since it has a Michelin star but overall I was a little disappointed. For ramen, I still prefer Ichiran.The appetizers were good! Gyoza was really tasty and had a good meat to veggies ratio. Chicken bun is worth trying as it has really unique flavors that mesh well together.For the spicy tan tan ramen - I was expecting more from the broth and found it to be on the oily side. I didn't find anything particularly unique about the flavor. It had a hint of spice and a hint of sweetness which isn't my preference. I prefer spicy foods to be spicy and savory. The spring onion and the chasu within the  ramen were the standout pieces. I can also say this has been the best chasu I've ever had - flavorful and melt in your mouth quality. The noodles tasted more manufactured than homemade and thicker than what I prefer.Mango shaved ice was good but it was one of those shaved ice dishes where they put in mango flavoring and not as much fresh mango. The honey flavored cream gave a nice balance to the sweetness.Worth trying if you're curious but I do think there's better ramen spots around. The restaurant itself is really beautiful and great for a date night! Service was also solid.","13 W 36th St New York, NY 10018"

I chose the ""fish"" and it was absolutely one of the best thing I ate here in New York.But why the 4 star? Although the broth is incredibly flavorful, it's a little on the salty side. Perhaps it's a preference but every time I taste too much salt, I feel they're masking something. The ""umami"" flavor should come from tonkatsu bone and not the salt. It's definitely good broth but the salt overpowered everything.","13 W 36th St New York, NY 10018"

2023-09-11,2023-09-16,Tonchin,"Tonchin has Michelin star ratings from multiple years, and I can see why!Make sure to make a reservation, because there always tends to be about a 30 minute wait otherwise. When I came here on a weekday evening, we only managed to get bar seating for 2 people.Here are the items I tried:1. Chicken Tsukune: sweet flavor and very crispy!! If you like chicken wings, then I highly recommend this dish2. Spicy Tan Tan Ramen: slightly spicy and very rich broth. Their take on tan tan noodles is decent, and if I were in the mood for something spicy, I would order this again3. Classic Tokyo Tonkotsu: this dish really stole the show. It is the best tonkotsu I have ever had. The broth is so rich with pork flavor, and it makes you understand why this place is Michelin ratedI definitely recommend stopping by tonchin for some ramen and chicken wings. I make an effort to visit everytime I visit new york","13 W 36th St New York, NY 10018"
2023-09-10,2023-09-16,Tonchin,"Stick to ramen if u come. Spicy maguro dish was so ladened with mayonnaise, the dish was practically inedible. Ramen was better. Noodles have good texture. Broth not too salty.","13 W 36th St New York, NY 10018"

2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Tonchin,"Yes, I still wanted ramen on a hot, humid day and this hit the spot! I order the spicy tsukemen and I honestly felt like it had the most flavor in comparison to my friend's dishes (classic tonchin ramen and classic non-spicy tsukemen).What we're really here to talk about is the matcha shaved ice dessert. The PERFECT palette cleanser at the end of the night.I will be coming here again, for sure.","13 W 36th St New York, NY 10018"
2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Tonchin,"Oh my gosh, YUM! I came for lunch and had the special. Chicken bun and Spicy Tan Tan. Both were amazing and a perfect portion. I arrived just as the opened and there was already a line, so remember to make a reservation. I was dining solo so had no trouble getting space at the bar. The restaurant is beautiful and the servers were very helpful and nice, answering any questions.","13 W 36th St New York, NY 10018"
2023-09-05,2023-09-16,Tonchin,"When friend wanted ramen in 90 degree weather and has never tried dipping ramen, I knew my job was to find a place in NYC that served what we were looking for. What a coincidence that Tonchin was around and as a bonus, Michelin starred.Tonchin offers a $25 lunch special with a main entree and a side. Friend and I decided to split the lunch special, so we ordered the spicy goma tsukemen ($3 more for this) and the shrimp rice ball (extra $1 for this). Since we were splitting, we added an extra shrimp rice ball ($8) so we can each enjoy a full side.The tsukemen was a hit with both of us and the portion was just enough to keep us both satiated. We found it amusing that the rice ball did not come in the shape of a rice ball, but looked more like a hand roll. Nevertheless, that was good too.We still had some room for dessert, so we got the matcha milk shaved ice ($18). Soooo good, no regrets ordering that, even though we struggled to finish the last few bites.Definitely want to come back for lunch at Tonchin for all my future NYC visits!","13 W 36th St New York, NY 10018"

You truly get to have the best time because you don't have to make any choices. Their melon gazpacho was the best thing I ate and I'm so sad I will probably never have it again. truly a once in a lifetime meal every time you go.

Everything I've had is truly fantastic and has gotten me to try things I usually wouldn't order. Love the team that works there - they are so kind and attentive. The restaurant is so cute too!

They list online what you'll be served and give you a card when you go to remind you. I'm sure hipsters think it's some type of cool, but with no choices and impossibly small portions I call the place a joke","86 S Portland Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"

It's better to arrive close to your reservation time rather than early as theres no room for waiting inside. The ambiance is absolutely homey and makes you feel like you're about to eat a familiar comfort food while still being a new and exciting experience. The details are all very personal with a flowery elegance that adds to your fairytale experience here. The service is excellent and accommodating, they take great care of you and are flexible for any needs you may have.The food is even better! I'm normally not a quiche lover but this was just divine. The excellent textures blended with exquisite flavors was exhilarating. I particularly loved the cashew ricotta- definitely the accidental staple of this meal. This is a great, trendy place to have an aesthetic girls brunch or any other celebratory event!","86 S Portland Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"
2023-05-01,2023-09-16,Dinner Party,"Came here for a 9PM reservation on a Saturday night with my brother. We were at the communal table which, when I booked, I was pretty nervous about. I imagined the communal table as a larger table with maybe 8 people, but when we arrived it was a small round table with just 4 of us. I was super nervous at first, but it ended up being a lot of fun. I think the people you are seated with really make or break the experience you have there.The food was amazing, the atmosphere was incredible, but if you're seated with people who aren't interested in chit chatting or are just plain nasty, the rest of the experience doesn't really matter and thats a really risky line to tow as a small restaurant in NYC, so I commend Dinner Party for stickin' to their communal guns!Right upon walking in I loved the atmosphere. Even on a cold rainy night, the table next to the front door was just fine (until later ... read till the end!) The decor was so cute and I loved that all of our plates were mismatched. Those little touches really made ""Dinner Party"" feel like a just that. I loved the intimacy.The service was great in some areas but a little lackluster in others. For starters, our server did not come to our table until after our first course arrived, which meant we hadn't even had a chance to order a drink yet! And then, our drinks didn't end up arriving until after we finished our second course, which was a huge bummer!They have a wine menu, but in small font on the side they say they have cocktails which I didn't catch at first. Our waiter was super kind and very excited to talk about cocktails. I loved his passion and talent! I asked for ""something fruity with tequila"" and man, this guy delivered! 3 out of the 4 people at our table ordered it as well, and we all loved it. I didn't even intend to get a drink that night ... nevermind two!!!The food was excellent, I loved that they had a vegetarian option for the main entree, and kept all of the appetizers leading up vegetarian as well. It's very inclusive and I'm excited to take my vegetarian boyfriend here.My only other issue besides our waiter taking so long to come to our table at first was that there was a man experiencing homelessness that came into the restaurant and started heckling us for money. Now, I know this Is not the restaurants fault, but I worked in food & bev for several years, and I had been asked many times to go speak to people heckling our tables outside. And this wasn't even outside! This man fully came into the restaurant! And when our entire table told him we didn't have money he got really mad! And not one, but two employees walked past us multiple times during this interaction and did NOTHING! Now, I'm not expecting them to come pick the guy up and carry him out of the restaurant, but how are you going to witness your paying customers being heckled and not at least try to offer some assistance? Interesting!I will definitely be coming back to Dinner Party as the other experiences I had that night outweighed the negatives!","86 S Portland Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"

We were seated inside in the back and the place was so beautifully decorated, with mood lighting and fun art. We started with drinks and I really liked the gin and tonic which had a refreshing cucumber taste. The meal started with a salad that was so vibrant and crunchy and fresh that I finished all of it! We then got the main, a chicken dish, while I got the vegetarian mushroom version with crispy potatoes. I tried the chicken and it was a little lackluster, but the fried mushroom was very flavorful and the potatoes provided such nice texture! Ended the meal with this amazing halwa with coffee ice cream that just paired beautifully!The place is small so make sure to make a reservation. The bath door doorknob also fell off when one of my friends was inside, but it wasn't a big deal.","86 S Portland Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"

2023-02-06,2023-09-16,Dinner Party,"Dinner Party is a Fort Greene restaurant serving a rotating, seasonally-influenced prix-fixe menu. As the name suggests, the ambiance of Dinner Party is akin to if you had been invited over to a friend's apartment for dinner. Diners have the option to sit a communal table and meet other diners or to opt for a private table. The menu included a black sesame cracker and cheese plate for an appetizer. The next course was a beet salad followed by a sweet potato gnocchi with kale. Dessert was a creamy tahini gelato served with honey and date. Dinner Party is a great place to (maybe) mingle and enjoy food that feels elegantly home cooked.","86 S Portland Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217"

There's a lot better Thai options in NYC.* Spicy Tom Yum Noodles (2/5)The broth didn't have a lot of flavor. It tasted of just lemongrass, lime, and some spice. The noodles it came with was not the noodles I expected and reminded me of packaged egg ramen in a bad way. It didn't match the soup. The seafood (scallop, mussel, shrimp) was not fresh and overcooked. I wouldn't get again. It did come with crunchy mushrooms.","235 Sullivan St New York, NY 10012"

We also shared the appetizer platter. We chose the edamame, crispy chicken dumplings, and roti massaman. All good options; nothing really outstanding.Not a bad spot for a quick lunch. I'd give 3.5 stars if possible. I would recommend getting the lunch special during a week day. We didn't, and I thought the prices were a bit inflated.","235 Sullivan St New York, NY 10012"

Both outstanding! We ordered on the phone for pick up and within 10-15 when we arrived it was ready to go. Carried it back to Washington Square village and it was still piping hot when we got to our room.The only problem now is that we leave town tomorrow and will make our way back to San Antonio where we have yet to find Thai food this good in the last 7 years we have lived there.Top Thai, you will be missed!","235 Sullivan St New York, NY 10012"

As I eagerly opened the delivery bag, I discovered that my entire order was complete. I had chosen the enchiladas mole with Spanish rice, accompanied by a refreshing lemonade.To my satisfaction, the food was still warm to the touch and tasted quite impressive. Despite my initial concerns about ordering in, I had no regrets.

2023-07-04,2023-09-16,Jajaja Mexicana,"In summary, a place with great decor/natural lighting but okay food/prices leave more to be desired.Decided to come here for an impromptu lunch on a Sunday, and I didn't realize that it's in Whole Foods next to the buffet area! The nice thing is that it does have its own entrance/exit which leads you to the bridge connected to the High Line.You order at the counter, and there's a decent menu available. Note that everything is vegan! Water is available for free and they also have bottled cocktails which is neat. The person who took our order at the register wiped down our table and gave us cups of water / utensils.I ordered the Taco Tazón Bowl ($17) and Guacamole and Chips ($11). The guacamole was delicious, but the portion size was so small for the price. You get like four large chips which are basically half a hard shell taco. The taco bowl was a better portion, but it wasn't that good in my opinion... the fake chorizo was good, and the pieces of avocado were fresh, but everything else was eh and I didn't end up finishing it.","450 W 33rd St Whole Foods New York, NY 10001"
2023-06-15,2023-09-16,Jajaja Mexicana,"This location of Jajaja has its pros and cons but for the right occasion it is just perfect.I was surprised to see that they opened inside the Whole Foods in Hudson Yards.  I generally avoid eating in Whole Foods, especially when you have to pay restaurant prices.  And that too in Hudson Yards (a failed urban experiment)?  But the restaurant space is cleverly isolated from the rest of Whole Foods and has a modern and fresh look.  Seating is plentiful and the menu choices are as good as at the other locations of Jajaja.  What you lose in easy access and the feel of being in a bustling restaurant you gain in the relatively quiet setting and the access to clean indoor and outdoor seating without needing to make a reservation.Last time I visited here with a friend for a long-overdue catchup.  I tried the Rainbow Chard bowl with tofu, corn, tomatoes and thin, crispy plantain chips. It was light and tasty, and the ingredients were fresh.  The grapefruit-ginger mocktail was a perfect complement.I will be back here for another healthy dinner in a conversation-friendly setting soon.","450 W 33rd St Whole Foods New York, NY 10001"

2022-09-11,2023-09-16,Henry's End,"I went here a few weeks back having originally wanted to go to nearby Inga's but they were closed as some of the staff members had Covid so I stopped here. They have an interesting menu with a mix of game and pasta with  a variety of influences. I got their Banana Boulevardier to drink ($15 like all the other cocktails) which consisted of Four Roses bourbon, Dolan dry vermouth, Campari, and Giffard Banane du Brésil. It was sweet of course with a nice bite at the end from the liqueur and I enjoyed it. They gave some bread after I ordered which was tasty and different from those places.My appetizer was the agnolotti with English pea and ricotta with pancetta, grana padano, and mint oil which is $16 or $28 for a dinner sized portion. It was tasty pasta nicely cooked al dente with a good rich filling. I almost liked the topping on top more than the filling because of the nice mix of salty pancetta and the cheese and I thought it was delicious.My main dish was the blackened lamb sirloin which was sliced over mashed potatoes with a BBQ glaze and it was $36. By comparison to my appetizer, There was a good amount of lamb but some pieces could have been a bit more tender but it was still well seasoned; perhaps overly so. I think maybe some people would find it a bit too blackened as it was a bit bitter occasionally. The mashed potatoes were a bit of a throwaway being properly made but a bit bland and overall the main was good but not as good as the appetizer.The prices were a bit high here but the food was tasty. Perhaps a bit pricey for the quality but no major complaints outside of a couple of the pieces of lamb. Low 4.","72 Henry St Brooklyn, NY 11201"

I'm a sucker for chicken so the rabbit was my favorite sacrificial meal for the night.Taking a trip down south is kind of a hassle so I'm definitely coming back to eat things that isn't chicken but tastes like chicken.

2023-09-10,2023-09-16,12 Chairs,"Food okay, atmosphere good but service was a first for me.  Was told not to order multiple small plates as they wouldn't fit on the table.  Asked if they could replate to a single larger plate or otherwise accommodate the order and was told to order something else.  Changed my order as requested, ate my dinner, paid/tipped as usual but won't go back.","56 MacDougal St New York, NY 10012"

2023-09-04,2023-09-16,12 Chairs,This is a spot I will take people to again and again. The food is always so delicious. If you go you MUST get the hummus (which comes with  pickles and olives - my favorites) and the chocolate mousse. Everything is pretty yummy; you can't go wrong with any dish. The servers are very sweet and it is such a fun vibe inside. The outside is nice too but can get a little cramped.,"56 MacDougal St New York, NY 10012"

I ordered the Borek was very flavorful! The service was alright. The orange juice was overpriced. It was a very small glass with no refills. We also shared shipudim and the chicken was very good. So good I forgot to take a picture before we ate! Overall the experience was alright, and it was a good breakfast.","56 MacDougal St New York, NY 10012"

My water cup was never empty!The food was good but nothing amazing. It was just a nice bowl of ramen on a regular day week day. My favourite item that I got had to be the Yuzu iced tea, it was so refreshing and different! My restaurant was small, clean and modern. Bonus that it was cool, i'm not sure NY is always this hot but it was boiling when I was there.3 stars for the food extra star for the service!What we got:TakoyakiYuzu iced teaShoyu ramenTonkatsu ramen","330 8th Ave New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-08,2023-09-16,Kame,Delicious food! I got the salmon Don on two occasions. The staff was really nice and attentive. It was quite busy both times I went on the evenings.

2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Kame,"Eating at Kame was a really enjoyable experience. The ambiance was perfect -- crowded and noisy but not too much that it was hard to hear. I got the spicy vegan ramen and a bun and they were both excellent. The ramen especially was very flavorful, on the thicker side, with perfectly chewy noodles. I'd love to come back again!","330 8th Ave New York, NY 10001"
2023-09-07,2023-09-16,Kame,"The food was out immediately. The waiters were super amicable as well.Although the proportions were not as large as it seems, it surprisingly fills you up. The matcha panna cotta was absolutely delicious!Also, the tonkotsu ramen and karage curry chicken was like a flavor bomb. would recommend this place.","330 8th Ave New York, NY 10001"
2023-08-31,2023-09-16,Kame,"Kame Ramen has its charm, and while there were some aspects that stood out, a few details left me slightly torn. As a ramen enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for new places to indulge in this comforting dish, and Kame Ramen offered an interesting experience.I ordered their Tonkotsu Ramen, and while the flavor profile was on point, there were a couple of aspects that caught my attention. The broth was delicious, showcasing a robust depth that hinted at hours of simmering, and the pork belly caught my eye with its inviting presentation. However, I must note that the pork belly, while looking appealing, was surprisingly thin. The taste was there, but I would've appreciated a more substantial cut.The noodles were well-cooked and had a satisfying texture, and the accompanying vegetables added a nice crunch to the dish. One thing to highlight is the absence of an egg in my bowl, which might be a letdown for those who enjoy that element in their ramen.The ambiance of the place is cozy, making it a decent spot for a casual meal. The service was attentive and the staff friendly, which added to the overall positive impression.What deserves special mention is their homemade chili oil - a wonderful condiment that brings a delightful kick to the experience. It definitely spiced up my ramen just the way I like it!While Kame Ramen didn't entirely blow me away, it does have potential. With a bit of tweaking, such as addressing the thin pork belly and potentially offering egg as an option, this place could easily become a top contender for ramen lovers in the area.","330 8th Ave New York, NY 10001"
2023-08-31,2023-09-16,Kame,Ramen (tontaksu and salmon) was amazing and super affordable for midtown. Service quick and attentive.  Very chill. Clean restaurant and bathrooms.Def stop here if you've got time to kill before a train out.,"330 8th Ave New York, NY 10001"

2023-08-20,2023-09-16,Kame,"I can't eat pork so I ordered the shrimp ramen and it's seriously so good, it made me not miss pork. My husband ordered the Tonkatsu and he absolutely loved it. The staff is also highly attentive and efficient. Highly recommended. I'd post a pic but I ate it all.","330 8th Ave New York, NY 10001"
2023-08-09,2023-09-16,Kame,"The Ramen is a little generic and doesn't have that many add ons in it by default, but it was still tasty. It didn't seem salty like most Ramen but I think it could have had a slightly more flavorful broth. The service was good as we had to send a Ramen back and they promptly brought out a replacement. I'm not sure if I will go back, but it met expectations.","330 8th Ave New York, NY 10001"
2023-08-05,2023-09-16,Kame,"The gyoza were interestingly shaped and faintly crisp, more delicate than I'm accustomed to.  The takoyaki was rich but not gooey, though it was hard to discern the squid.  Broth of tonkotsu ramen  was fragrant and hearty with perfect level of saltiness.  The extra onsen egg didn't necessarily enhance the experience but was an interesting element.","330 8th Ave New York, NY 10001"
2023-08-18,2023-09-16,Chino Grande,"Something happened to me here that I never had in 10 years living in NYC. The bartender refused to serve me a drink whereas I was sober. He would not even serve the rest of our table. I asked him why he refused and the only explanation he gave me is that "" he is the bartender and can decide whatever he wants "". I understand that if someone is drunk and/or creating trouble, you might want not to serve them a drink. That was not my case nor any of my friends. We were a table of two girls and two guys. Two of our friends sang really well. Everyone was sober and in a good mood. I still don't understand this bartender's behavior, especially without giving any explanation. The good news is that there are plenty of other great bars in NYC :)","253 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-08-01,2023-09-16,Chino Grande,"Went for dinner on a Friday just before the karaoke. Did not stay for karaoke.Got a few things to share: chips & sauces, char siu pork rib bites, wonton toast, chaufa, shrimp saltado, chorizo rolls, sizzling beef, fried chicken bites (chicharron). Pretty much the whole menu. Really liked the food - quite inventive and tasty, some sort of Asian and Latin American fusion. My least favorite dish was the pork rib bites.Had the spicy margarita cocktail - was delicious. Did not get dessert.Service was friendly and upbeat - really liked the energy and attention!","253 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-07-30,2023-09-16,Chino Grande,"Completely insane. Esp for those of us who grew up w Chinese home cooking, these folks are not only doing it justice, but bringing it next level--ok more like next 3-5 levels. Fried congee fritters? Genius. Crab Rangoon toast. Wut. Even the rice was *perfection*. Drinks were amazing. The flavor of the Pandan pina colada was mind blowing. I would drink this from a bucket if available. Most of the restaurant was either drinking that or a Chiquita chinita, which was a sour, smoky mezcal-based drink from the heavens!!! I'm a fan. Will def come back to try diff things, as it seems like the menu changes a lot bc this chef cannot hold back on giving his kitchen gifts to the world!!! Also karaoke!! Also an outstanding staff--hip, stylish, polite and cordial without being over the top. Feels like you're just hanging out w the coolest folks in BK! Very memorable experience. VERY RECOMMENDED.","253 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-05-09,2023-09-16,Chino Grande,"Massively underrated spot. Are you going on a date with someone who's turned on by novelty? Look no further - this menu is super fun and adventurous. It slaps. I haven't had a mediocre dish yet.The staff are super friendly and accomodating. And you can tell they really love the menu.The cocktails are super fun, interesting, and well balanced.I think my favorite dish was the Calabrian chili mushrooms. My god.","253 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-05-04,2023-09-16,Chino Grande,"Wine bar with an eclectic menu and late night karaoke. We walked in on a Thursday night and we're seated immediately at the bar. Plenty of walk in availability.Very solid wine list. There were fourteen wines by the glass which the staff made sure were still good. Lots of skin contact and natural options. Pretty nice variety. I started with a no vintage sparkling Chardonnay that was offered with a happy hour discount. I followed it up with a couple natural wines from Oregon and France. Pretty happy with the line up. Appreciated the large selection of wines by the glass.They had seven beers on draft which mostly focused on local crafts. Also a nice variety of cocktails. The bartender was attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly.For starters, we shared the crispy cauliflower and the mussels. Cauliflower was topped with shaved bonito, scallions, and I believe a mayo based sauce. Felt like a heavily influenced Japanese dish. The mussels were your quintessential Belgian/French bowl with a buttery red sauce with capers. Sauce was so good that we had an extra order of bread which I believe is baked at Ops. Would highly recommend both.For the main course, my wife had the buttermilk fried chicken which were huge boneless chunks of meat with a spicy seasoning a a coconut ranch. Chicken was super juicy. Almost like a southern South Pacific fusion. I had the Hawaiian Miso Kampachi which was super nostalgic of whitefish on an everything bagel emulated by the creamy mixture between the tofu sauce and fish as well as the seasoning on the dish.For dessert, we shared the banana miso custard which my wife loved as it disappeared within minutes.We didn't witness the karaoke festivities which usually start around 10 though I'd be interested to return for the shenanigans. I loved how varied the menu was. Super creative and diverse. Staff was attentive and service was quick. Two gender neutral restrooms. They had an exterior sink for convenience.","253 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-03-26,2023-09-16,Chino Grande,"This place never disappoints. The fried rice was a tad salty. The eggplant skewer was delish for me but too sweet for hubs. The mussels and mushrooms were PERFECT, as were our cocktails.The nicest part: they'd forgotten to fire up the lobster au poivre that we ordered, but we were not gonna complain because we were beyond full. But they were kind enough to then comp our four cocktails to make up for the error! Such customer-centric-ness is refreshing, thanks guys!!!","253 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-03-14,2023-09-16,Chino Grande,"The ambience of this place was so much cuter and cozier than expected on the outside. When it says they have karaoke, I was thinking it would be more of a dive bar, but it actually felt like a romantic date spot.Every dish we had was good but very small only enough for 2 to 3 people. Max. The drinks were great and would definitely love to come back.","253 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-02-19,2023-09-16,Chino Grande,"TLDR: I've been multiple times and every time the food slaps. Worth it just for the food but karaoke is the cherry on top of the cake!SETTING: nice large restaurant and crowd differs depending on which day you go. When I went during the work week for dinner. the restaurant was practically empty with a family (+small child) eating dinner and filling up a little bit more when leaving around 9. When I went on a weekend night for karaoke, almost every seat in the place was taken.  It's perfect for family dinner, dinner with friends, any occasion really.FOOD: the food is the absolute standout here which is how I prefer my restaurants :) the little gem salad is spectacular and my mouth is watering just thinking about that perfectly dressed, textured, salad. Just soooo good. May be one of my favorite salads ever.Everything else I've ever eaten here has been good including the grande fries (so f-ing good, you will demolish these), the fried chicken, the rice, the BEEF TARTARE.... wow. I have never eaten anything here that I didn't like. It always hits the spot - each dish is balanced with acidity, crunch, sweet, savory. I don't know how they do it, but they do it VERY well.SERVICE: service is always good here and you never have to wait long to be helped or served.VERDICT: one of my favorite spots in Williamsburg! The food is incredible here and trust me, you won't regret going. I know I will definitely be back.","253 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"
2023-02-12,2023-09-16,Chino Grande,"Had to try this new spot after hearing so many good things. Have no regrets ! I wasn't able to stay for it but apparently the restaurant converts to karaoke bar at 11pm. As for the food I'd recommend the salad, the croquetas, the chicken and swordfish skewers, and Korean fried chicken. The beef tartare was a little salty for my likings but still good. It's a tapas style restaurant so everything is meant to be shared. Our waitress helped us narrow down our order to fit out palette. Liked it a lot!","253 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

Everything was so good but the fried skate is NOT TO BE MISSED!  The outside is crispy and crunchy, the meat was heafty yet light and broke apart like crab meat. It was just ::chefs kiss:: phenomenal. We both raved about how perfect that dish was.  We had a 730 pm dinner and didn't realize they had karaoke after. The staff were wonderful performers and made us feel so comfortable. Can't wait to visit again!","253 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211"

The dumplings were good, had a nice amount of filling, and a nice crisp from the pan frying. Dan dan mien were good and flavorful. The sesame pancake was good, but I would get a filling with it next time.There are a few large tables, but it's not a sit down restaurant so most people sit and leave quickly.

The food that I had at Vanessa's definitely took me back to the wonderful memories from my trip! I had some delicious pork and chive boiled dumplings and a really good vegetable sesame pancake.
